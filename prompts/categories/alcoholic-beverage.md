}
```

### 6. SULFITE DECLARATION (27 CFR 7.22, 4.32, 5.32)

**üö® CRITICAL for wines and some beers/ciders**

**Check:**

- Potentially-Non-Compliant: Product type suggests sulfites likely present (e.g., wine) but declaration unclear
- Non-Compliant: Sulfites likely ‚â•10 ppm but not declared (especially for wine)

**Guidance:**
- Assume wine requires sulfite declaration unless label states "No Sulfites Added" AND meets organic standards
- Beer/spirits: Only flag if sulfites explicitly mentioned in ingredients without "Contains Sulfites" statement

### 7. ALLERGEN LABELING (FALCPA - applies to alcoholic beverages)

**üö® APPLIES TO ALL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES** per FALCPA Section 403(w)

**STEP 1**: Identify if ANY of the 9 major food allergens are present in ingredients or processing:
- Milk, Egg, Fish, Crustacean shellfish, Tree nuts, Wheat, Peanuts, Soybeans, Sesame

**Common allergens in alcoholic beverages:**
- **Wheat**: Beer, some vodkas, whiskey
- **Barley** (not a major allergen but may contain gluten from wheat cross-contact)
- **Milk/Egg**: Fining agents in wine (isinglass from fish, egg whites, milk proteins)
- **Tree nuts**: Nut-flavored liqueurs (Amaretto, Frangelico)

**STEP 2**: IF NO allergens present:
- Status: "compliant"
- Explanation: "No major food allergens detected. Product is compliant with FALCPA as there are no allergens to declare."

**STEP 3**: IF allergens ARE present:
- Check for "Contains:" statement OR parenthetical declarations in ingredient list
- All present allergens must be declared in plain language
- **Exception**: Allergens may be in ingredient list if clearly identified (e.g., "Wheat malt", "Milk protein")

**üö® ABSOLUTE RULE**: ONLY use "potentially_non_compliant" or "non_compliant" if you have CONFIRMED allergens ARE PRESENT. If ZERO allergens detected, status MUST be "compliant".

**Status Assignment:**
- Compliant: No allergens present OR all present allergens properly declared
- Potentially-Non-Compliant: Allergens likely present (e.g., wheat in beer) but declaration unclear
- Non-Compliant: Allergens confirmed present but not declared

### 8. MISLEADING STATEMENTS CHECK (27 CFR 7.29, 4.39, 5.42)

**Check for FALSE or MISLEADING statements:**
- Geographic origin claims without substantiation (e.g., "Imported from France" when bottled domestically)
- Age statements not meeting TTB standards
- Organic claims without USDA certification
- Imitation of competitor's trade dress
- False "Government approval" implications beyond COLA

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå "Approved by FDA as healthy beverage"
- ‚ùå "Champagne" for sparkling wine not from Champagne, France
- ‚ùå "Kentucky Bourbon" for spirits not meeting bourbon standards
- ‚úÖ "Bottled in California" with local address

**Status Assignment:**
- Compliant: No misleading statements detected
- Potentially-Non-Compliant: Statements require verification (e.g., origin claims)
- Non-Compliant: Clear misleading or false statements present

### 9. MANUFACTURER/DISTRIBUTOR INFORMATION

**Check:**
- Bottler, importer, or distributor name present?
- Complete address with city and state (or country if imported)?
- Proper qualifying phrase? ("Bottled by", "Imported by", "Produced and bottled by")
- Meets mandatory labeling requirements per 27 CFR?

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ Compliant: "Bottled by Mountain Brewery, Denver, CO", "Imported by XYZ Importers, New York, NY"
- ‚ùå Non-Compliant: Missing address, no city/state, missing qualifying phrase

**Status Assignment:**
- Compliant: Complete manufacturer/distributor information present
- Potentially-Non-Compliant: Partial information or illegible
- Non-Compliant: Missing manufacturer/distributor name or address

### 10. COLA REQUIREMENT (Certificate of Label Approval)

**Background:**
- All alcoholic beverages sold in US require TTB COLA approval before market
- COLA number may or may not appear on consumer label
- This analysis cannot verify COLA approval directly

**Check:**
- COLA number visible on label? (Optional to display, but note if present)
- Any TTB approval statement?

**Recommendation Note:**
- ALWAYS include recommendation: "Ensure product has valid TTB COLA (Certificate of Label Approval) before distribution. COLA approval is mandatory per 27 CFR and must be obtained prior to market release."

**Status:**
- Set as "Not Verifiable from Label" in compliance evaluation
- Always flag in recommendations as CRITICAL priority

---

## STEP 3: OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Determine primary_compliance_status:**
- **Compliant**: Meets all TTB alcoholic beverage requirements, no violations found
  - Must have: proper labeling, alcohol content, net contents, health warning, no prohibited claims
- **Potentially-Non-Compliant**: Likely violations present but depends on information not fully visible or verifiable
  - Examples: Health warning unclear/illegible, sulfite declaration uncertain, allergen status ambiguous
- **Non-Compliant**: Clear violations of TTB regulations
  - Examples: Missing health warning, prohibited health claims, wrong/misleading class designation, missing required elements

**Provide 2-3 sentence summary** highlighting:
- Whether all required elements present (alcohol content, health warning, net contents, manufacturer info)
- Prohibited claims detected (if any)
- Critical areas needing immediate attention

**Example Summaries:**

*Compliant:*
"This wine label includes all required TTB elements: accurate class designation (Table Wine), alcohol content (13.5% ABV), net contents (750 mL), proper health warning statement, and bottler information. A sulfite declaration is present as required. No prohibited health claims were detected."

*Non-Compliant:*
"This beer label is missing the mandatory government health warning per 27 CFR 16.21, which is a critical violation. Additionally, the brand name 'Heart-Healthy Hops IPA' constitutes a prohibited health claim per 27 CFR 7.54. The label must be revised before distribution."

---

## STEP 4: RECOMMENDATIONS

**Prioritize recommendations:**
- **CRITICAL**: Must fix immediately before distribution (missing health warning, prohibited health claims, missing COLA approval, missing alcohol content/net contents)
- **HIGH**: Important compliance issues (incorrect warning wording, missing sulfite declaration, misleading statements)
- **MEDIUM**: Minor improvements (placement issues, legibility concerns, incomplete manufacturer info)
- **LOW**: Best practice suggestions (voluntary disclosures, formatting improvements)

**For each recommendation:**
- Specific, actionable instruction
- Relevant regulation citation (27 CFR section)
- Priority level
- Clear explanation of why it's required

**Example Recommendations:**

**CRITICAL:**
- "Add the mandatory government health warning with exact wording per 27 CFR 16.21: 'GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.' This warning must appear conspicuously on the label."
- "Remove prohibited health claim 'Heart-Healthy' from brand name or marketing text. Health claims are prohibited on alcoholic beverage labels per 27 CFR 7.54."
- "Ensure product has valid TTB COLA (Certificate of Label Approval) before distribution. COLA approval is mandatory per 27 CFR Part 13 and must be obtained prior to market release."

**HIGH:**
- "Add 'Contains Sulfites' declaration per 27 CFR 4.32(e). Sulfite disclosure is required for wine when sulfites are present at 10 ppm or greater."
- "Correct health warning text - current version is missing required punctuation and has incorrect wording. Must match 27 CFR 16.21 exactly."

**MEDIUM:**
- "Add complete address for bottler including city and state per 27 CFR 7.25 for full compliance."
- "Consider adding metric equivalent for net contents (e.g., '12 FL OZ (355 mL)') for consumer clarity, though not required per 27 CFR 7.23."

**LOW:**
- "Consider voluntary ingredient disclosure for consumer transparency, though not required for this product type under TTB regulations."

## REMEMBER: Category Confidence

Since you've been told this is an ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE, always set:
- `"category_confidence": "high"`
- `"category_ambiguity": { "is_ambiguous": false, ... }`

Only set `is_ambiguous: true` if you find STRONG evidence the classification was wrong (e.g., non-alcoholic beverage <0.5% ABV, clearly a food product not an alcoholic beverage).
