# Priority Classification System & Print-Ready Certification

**Status:** Design Approved - Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2025-10-29

---

## Problem Statement

The current priority system has ambiguous MEDIUM classification that mixes:
- Minor regulatory requirements (must fix)
- Best practices (nice to have)
- Edge cases (requires judgment)

**Impact:** Users can't determine when their label is "print-ready" because they don't know if MEDIUM items are required or optional.

---

## Solution: Refined 4-Tier Priority System

### **CRITICAL** - Blocking Violations
**Definition:** Clear FDA/TTB violation with serious enforcement risk

**Enforcement Risk:**
- Warning letters
- Product recalls
- Fines and penalties
- Market withdrawal orders

**Examples:**
- Missing allergen declaration (FALCPA violation)
- Wrong panel type (Supplement Facts on food product)
- Prohibited health claims ("cures cancer", "prevents disease")
- Missing government warning on alcoholic beverages
- Non-GRAS ingredient without approval
- False/misleading net weight declaration

**User Guidance:** "Must fix before printing. High risk of FDA enforcement action."

---

### **HIGH** - Required Compliance Issues
**Definition:** Regulatory requirement that must be fixed, but lower immediate enforcement priority

**Enforcement Risk:**
- Could trigger FDA attention during inspection
- May be cited in warning letters alongside CRITICAL issues
- Lower probability of immediate enforcement action
- Generally fixable without product recall

**Examples:**
- Incorrect ingredient order (21 CFR 101.4)
- Missing manufacturer address details
- Improper nutrition facts formatting (missing required nutrients)
- Incorrect net weight units or formatting
- Missing "Contains:" statement when allergens present (but allergen in ingredient list)
- Fortification policy violations (inappropriate vehicle)

**User Guidance:** "Regulatory requirement. Fix before printing to ensure full compliance."

---

### **MEDIUM** - Judgment Calls & Edge Cases
**Definition:** Ambiguous situations requiring professional judgment OR rare edge case requirements

**Characteristics:**
- Not clearly black-and-white in regulations
- May depend on context not visible in label image
- Rare or niche regulatory requirements
- "Gray area" interpretations where experts might disagree

**Examples:**
- Potentially misleading wording (requires interpretation of "misleading")
- Ambiguous structure/function claims (line between compliant and non-compliant is blurry)
- **Allergen uncertainty** - "natural flavors" may contain allergens, requires supplier verification
- **Ingredient composition unknown** - "artificial cream flavor" may contain milk, requires verification
- Allergen warnings for "may contain" (not legally required but industry practice)
- Font size/legibility concerns (subjective assessment from image)
- Exemption eligibility (depends on factors not visible: company size, distribution)
- Net weight placement (regulation says "prominent" but doesn't define pixel location)
- Old dietary ingredients uncertainty (ingredient may be pre-1994 but not in database)

**User Guidance:** "Review recommended. May require professional judgment or depend on factors not visible in the label."

**Key Principle:** When section status is "potentially_non_compliant" due to insufficient information (not due to visible violation), the recommendation priority should be **MEDIUM**, not CRITICAL or HIGH.

---

### **LOW** - Best Practices & Optimization
**Definition:** Optional improvements for better consumer experience, industry standards, or future-proofing

**Characteristics:**
- Not regulatory requirements
- Voluntary disclosures
- Competitive advantages
- Consumer-friendly enhancements

**Examples:**
- Voluntary nutrient declarations (fiber on products not required to have nutrition panel)
- QR codes for additional information
- "Non-GMO" or "Organic" claims (if not making claims, just suggestions)
- Allergen-friendly facility statements
- Sustainability/sourcing information
- Improved label readability suggestions
- Metric conversions (when not required)
- Additional language translations

**User Guidance:** "Optional. Consider these improvements to enhance consumer trust and product appeal."

## Mapping Section Status to Recommendation Priority

### Decision Tree: "potentially_non_compliant" Sections

When a section has status `"potentially_non_compliant"`, use this logic to determine recommendation priority:

```
IF violation is visible on label:
  → CRITICAL or HIGH (depending on enforcement risk)

ELSE IF insufficient information to determine compliance:
  → MEDIUM (requires verification/judgment)

NEVER use CRITICAL/HIGH when uncertainty is due to lack of information
```

### Examples: Section Status → Recommendation Priority

#### **Example 1: Allergen Labeling - "Natural Flavors"**

**Section Status:** `potentially_non_compliant`

**AI Analysis:**
```
"The ingredient list includes 'natural flavors,' which may contain
major food allergens. Cannot determine allergen content from label
alone. If natural flavors contain milk, egg, or other major allergens,
a 'Contains:' statement is required per FALCPA."
```

**Recommendation Priority:** **MEDIUM**

**Recommendation Text:**
```
"Cannot determine allergen status of 'natural flavors' from label
alone. Verify with your flavor supplier that no major food allergens
(milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans,
sesame) are present. If allergens ARE present, add 'Contains:' statement
per FALCPA Section 403(w). If no allergens present, no action needed."
```

**Rationale:** We don't know if there's a violation. Sarah needs to check with her supplier. If she's done her homework and confirmed no allergens, she can print. This is MEDIUM (verification needed), not CRITICAL (violation confirmed).

---

#### **Example 2: Allergen Labeling - Missing Declaration (Visible)**

**Section Status:** `non_compliant`

**AI Analysis:**
```
"Ingredient list contains 'whey protein' which is a milk derivative.
No 'Contains: Milk' statement found. This violates FALCPA Section 403(w)."
```

**Recommendation Priority:** **CRITICAL**

**Recommendation Text:**
```
"CRITICAL: Ingredient 'whey protein' contains MILK, which is a major
food allergen. You MUST add a 'Contains: Milk' statement after the
ingredient list or use parenthetical declaration 'whey protein (milk)'
per FALCPA Section 403(w). Missing allergen declarations can result
in FDA enforcement action and product recalls."
```

**Rationale:** Violation is clearly visible. Milk allergen is present but not declared. This is CRITICAL (blocking issue).

---

#### **Example 3: Ingredient Order - Visible Violation**

**Section Status:** `non_compliant`

**AI Analysis:**
```
"Ingredients appear listed as: Water, Natural Flavors, Sugar, Coffee Extract.
However, the product is labeled as 'Cold Brew Coffee,' suggesting coffee
should be a predominant ingredient. Ingredients must be listed in descending
order by weight per 21 CFR 101.4."
```

**Recommendation Priority:** **HIGH**

**Recommendation Text:**
```
"Ingredients must be listed in descending order by predominance by weight
(21 CFR 101.4). The current order suggests 'natural flavors' outweighs
'coffee extract' in a coffee product, which may be incorrect. Verify
ingredient weights and reorder accordingly. Example: 'Water, Coffee Extract,
Natural Flavors, Sugar' if coffee is the second-most predominant ingredient."
```

**Rationale:** This is a clear regulatory requirement that's violated. But it's lower enforcement risk than allergen violations, so it's HIGH (not CRITICAL).

---

#### **Example 4: Font Size - Cannot Verify**

**Section Status:** `potentially_non_compliant`

**AI Analysis:**
```
"The net weight statement appears small in the image. FDA regulations require
minimum 1/16 inch type size for principal display panel text. Cannot accurately
measure font size from image alone."
```

**Recommendation Priority:** **MEDIUM**

**Recommendation Text:**
```
"FDA requires minimum 1/16 inch (1.6mm) type size for net weight on the
principal display panel (21 CFR 101.105). The font appears small in the
image but cannot be measured accurately. Verify the actual printed type
size meets the minimum requirement. If measuring is difficult, consult
with your label printer."
```

**Rationale:** Can't determine compliance from image. Sarah needs to measure the physical label. This is MEDIUM (requires verification), not HIGH (visible violation).

---

#### **Example 5: Old Dietary Ingredient - Not in Database**

**Section Status:** `potentially_non_compliant` (for supplements)

**AI Analysis:**
```
"Ingredient 'cordyceps mushroom extract' is not found in the FDA NDI
database or our Old Dietary Ingredients list. If this ingredient was
NOT marketed before October 15, 1994, it requires an NDI notification
per DSHEA."
```

**Recommendation Priority:** **MEDIUM**

**Recommendation Text:**
```
"The ingredient 'cordyceps mushroom extract' is not in our Old Dietary
Ingredients database. If this ingredient was marketed in the U.S. before
October 15, 1994, no NDI notification is required (it's 'grandfathered').
If it's a new ingredient marketed after that date, you must file an NDI
notification with FDA 75 days before marketing. Verify the ingredient's
market history or consult with your supplier."
```

**Rationale:** Absence from database doesn't mean violation - it might be pre-1994 but just not in our list. Requires Sarah to verify history. MEDIUM (judgment/verification needed).

---

#### **Example 6: Structure/Function Claim - Ambiguous**

**Section Status:** `potentially_non_compliant`

**AI Analysis:**
```
"Claim states: 'Supports healthy immune function.' This is a structure/
function claim, which is acceptable for dietary supplements IF properly
qualified with disclaimer. However, the wording is close to the line of
an implied disease claim. FDA guidance on 'immune' claims is nuanced."
```

**Recommendation Priority:** **MEDIUM**

**Recommendation Text:**
```
"The claim 'supports healthy immune function' is borderline. Structure/
function claims are allowed with proper disclaimer, but 'immune' claims
can be interpreted as disease claims if they imply treatment/prevention
of disease. FDA guidance suggests focusing on 'normal immune function'
rather than 'healthy.' Consider revising to 'Supports normal immune
system function' and ensure disclaimer is present and prominent."
```

**Rationale:** This is a gray area where experts might disagree. It's not a clear violation, but it's not clearly safe either. MEDIUM (requires judgment), not HIGH (clear requirement).

---

### Summary Table

| Scenario | Section Status | Priority | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Allergen missing (visible on label) | `non_compliant` | **CRITICAL** | Clear violation, high enforcement risk |
| Allergen unknown ("natural flavors") | `potentially_non_compliant` | **MEDIUM** | Requires supplier verification |
| Ingredient order wrong (visible) | `non_compliant` | **HIGH** | Clear requirement, lower enforcement risk |
| Font size uncertain (can't measure) | `potentially_non_compliant` | **MEDIUM** | Requires physical measurement |
| NDI not in database | `potentially_non_compliant` | **MEDIUM** | Requires historical verification |
| Claim wording ambiguous | `potentially_non_compliant` | **MEDIUM** | Requires expert interpretation |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Reclassify AI Prompt (1 week)

**File to Update:** `app/api/analyze/route.ts`

**Changes Needed:**

1. **Update priority definitions in prompt:**

```typescript
const priorityDefinitions = `
PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM:

**CRITICAL** - Clear FDA violation with serious enforcement risk:
- Missing allergen declarations (FALCPA)
- Prohibited health/disease claims
- Wrong panel type (Supplement Facts on food, Nutrition Facts on supplement)
- Non-GRAS ingredients without approval
- Missing required warnings (alcoholic beverages)
- False/misleading net weight
→ High risk of warning letters, recalls, fines, or market withdrawal

**HIGH** - Regulatory requirement, lower enforcement priority:
- Incorrect ingredient order (21 CFR 101.4)
- Missing manufacturer address details
- Improper nutrition facts formatting
- Incorrect net weight units/format
- Fortification policy violations
- Missing secondary allergen declaration (when present in ingredients)
→ Must fix for full compliance, but lower immediate enforcement risk

**MEDIUM** - Requires judgment or rare edge cases:
- Potentially misleading wording (interpretation required)
- Ambiguous structure/function claims
- Allergen cross-contact warnings ("may contain" - not required)
- Font size/legibility from image analysis
- Exemption eligibility (depends on unseen factors)
- Old dietary ingredient uncertainty
→ Professional judgment recommended

**LOW** - Best practices and optional improvements:
- Voluntary nutrient declarations
- QR codes and additional information
- Optional claims (non-GMO, organic - if not currently claiming)
- Enhanced readability suggestions
- Metric conversions (when not required)
→ Optional enhancements for consumer appeal

IMPORTANT: If something is a regulatory REQUIREMENT, it MUST be CRITICAL or HIGH.
MEDIUM is ONLY for ambiguous/edge cases. LOW is ONLY for non-required best practices.
`;
```

2. **Add to analysis instructions:**

```typescript
When assigning recommendation priorities:

1. Ask: "Can I see a clear violation on this label?"
   → YES: Continue to step 2
   → NO: Continue to step 3

2. "Clear violation is visible"
   Ask: "What's the enforcement risk?"
   → High risk (allergens, prohibited claims, wrong panel): CRITICAL
   → Lower risk (formatting, order, minor omissions): HIGH

3. "Cannot determine or uncertain"
   Ask: "Why can't I determine?"
   → Insufficient info (natural flavors, can't measure font, not in database): MEDIUM
   → Ambiguous regulation (gray area, experts might disagree): MEDIUM
   → It's optional/best practice: LOW

CRITICAL RULE: "potentially_non_compliant" section status due to
INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION always maps to MEDIUM priority, never CRITICAL/HIGH.

Example:
- "natural flavors" may contain allergens → MEDIUM (verify with supplier)
- "whey" contains milk, no declaration → CRITICAL (visible violation)
```

### Phase 2: Add Print-Ready UI (1 week)

**New Component:** `components/PrintReadyCertification.tsx`

```typescript
interface PrintReadyCertificationProps {
  criticalCount: number;
  highCount: number;
  mediumCount: number;
  lowCount: number;
  analysisDate: string;
}

export function PrintReadyCertification({
  criticalCount,
  highCount,
  mediumCount,
  lowCount,
  analysisDate
}: PrintReadyCertificationProps) {
  const isPrintReady = criticalCount === 0 && highCount === 0;

  if (isPrintReady) {
    return <PrintReadyBanner />;
  } else {
    return <BlockingIssuesBanner />;
  }
}
```

**Files to Update:**
- `app/analyze/page.tsx` - Add certification banner after analysis
- `app/analysis/[id]/page.tsx` - Add certification banner in detail view
- `app/history/page.tsx` - Add print-ready badge in list view

### Phase 3: Update Recommendation Display (2 days)

**Changes:**
1. Group recommendations by priority
2. Show CRITICAL + HIGH in primary "Blocking Issues" section
3. Show MEDIUM + LOW in collapsible "Optional Improvements" section
4. Add priority badges with updated colors:
   - CRITICAL: Red (unchanged)
   - HIGH: Orange (unchanged)
   - MEDIUM: Yellow (unchanged)
   - LOW: Blue (unchanged)

### Phase 4: Add Disclaimer Text (1 day)

**Files to Update:**
- `components/PrintReadyCertification.tsx` - Full disclaimer
- `app/analyze/page.tsx` - Short disclaimer in header
- `app/analysis/[id]/page.tsx` - Short disclaimer in header

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (3-5 days)

**Test Cases:**

1. **True Print-Ready:**
   - Upload fully compliant label
   - Expect: Green "Print-Ready" banner
   - Verify: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH

2. **Blocking Issues:**
   - Upload label with missing allergen statement
   - Expect: Orange "Blocking Issues" banner
   - Verify: 1 CRITICAL shown prominently

3. **Priority Reclassification:**
   - Test ingredient order violation → Should be HIGH, not MEDIUM
   - Test "may contain" warning → Should be MEDIUM (judgment call)
   - Test QR code suggestion → Should be LOW (optional)

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Label with only MEDIUM items → Should show "Print-Ready" ✅
   - Label with only LOW items → Should show "Print-Ready" ✅
   - Label with 1 HIGH + 10 LOW → Should show "Blocking Issues" ⚠️

---

## Examples: Before & After Reclassification

### Example 1: Ingredient Order

**Before:**
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Rationale: "Minor violation, rarely enforced"

**After:**
- Priority: HIGH
- Rationale: "Clear regulatory requirement (21 CFR 101.4). Must fix for full compliance, though lower immediate enforcement risk than allergen violations."

---

### Example 2: "May Contain" Allergen Warning

**Before:**
- Priority: HIGH
- Rationale: "Allergen-related"

**After:**
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Rationale: "Not legally required by FALCPA. Industry best practice for shared equipment. Requires judgment based on manufacturing process."

---

### Example 3: QR Code Suggestion

**Before:**
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Rationale: "Good idea, recommended"

**After:**
- Priority: LOW
- Rationale: "Optional enhancement. Not a regulatory requirement. Improves consumer experience."

---

### Example 4: Font Size Concerns

**Before:**
- Priority: HIGH
- Rationale: "Might not meet minimum type size"

**After:**
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Rationale: "Cannot accurately measure font size from image. Regulation requires minimum 1/16 inch for principal display panel. Professional measurement recommended."

---

## Success Metrics

**User Confidence:**
- % of users who trust "Print-Ready" certification
- Support tickets about "Is my label ready?" should decrease
- User feedback on clarity of priority system

**System Accuracy:**
- Manual review of 100 analyses to validate priority assignments
- Zero critical regulatory requirements classified as MEDIUM or LOW
- Expert validation of MEDIUM classification (truly ambiguous)

**Business Impact:**
- Increased conversion from trial to paid (clear value delivered)
- Reduced support burden (fewer "what does this mean?" questions)
- Positive testimonials mentioning confidence/clarity

---

## Open Questions

1. **Expert Review:** Should we add "Request Expert Review" button for MEDIUM items?
2. **Certification Export:** Should print-ready certification be included in PDF exports?
3. **Historical Analyses:** How do we handle old analyses with current MEDIUM classification?
   - Option A: Re-run analysis with new system
   - Option B: Show banner "Analysis uses old priority system"
   - Option C: Leave as-is (only new analyses use new system)
