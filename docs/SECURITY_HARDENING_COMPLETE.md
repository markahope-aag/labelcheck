# Security Hardening - Complete Implementation

## Mozilla Observatory Scan Results

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Features

#### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented with cryptographic nonces

**Implementation**:
- Dynamic nonce generation using Web Crypto API (Edge Runtime compatible)
- Strict CSP directives limiting script sources to trusted domains only
- Nonce-based inline script execution for Next.js compatibility
- See: `lib/csp.ts` and `middleware.ts`

**Allowed Script Sources**:
- `'self'` - Same origin only
- `'nonce-XXXXX'` - Cryptographic nonces for inline scripts
- `https://challenges.cloudflare.com` - Bot protection
- `https://*.clerk.accounts.dev` - Authentication
- `https://js.stripe.com` - Payment processing

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents XSS attacks by blocking unauthorized scripts
- Mitigates data injection attacks
- Restricts resource loading to trusted sources

#### 2. Cookie Security Flags
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented with middleware enforcement

**Implementation**:
- `secureCookies()` helper function in middleware
- Uses `getSetCookie()` API for proper multi-cookie handling
- Adds security flags to all cookies, including third-party (Clerk)

**Flags Applied**:
- `Secure` - Only transmitted over HTTPS
- `HttpOnly` - Protected from JavaScript access (XSS prevention)
- `SameSite=Lax` - CSRF attack mitigation

**Edge Case Handling**:
- Preserves Clerk cookies that require JavaScript access (`__clerk_db`)
- Works correctly with Clerk test mode (local development)

#### 3. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Configured in `next.config.js`

**Configuration**:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

**Security Benefits**:
- Forces HTTPS for 2 years (63072000 seconds)
- Applies to all subdomains
- Eligible for browser HSTS preload list

#### 4. Additional Security Headers
**Status**: ‚úÖ All recommended headers configured

**Headers**:
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` - Clickjacking protection
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - MIME-sniffing prevention
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Legacy XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Privacy control
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` - Feature restrictions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Warnings (Expected for Modern React/Next.js Apps)

#### 1. Subresource Integrity (SRI)
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not implemented (informational warning)

**Why SRI isn't fully implemented**:

1. **Third-Party React Components**:
   - Clerk authentication uses official `@clerk/nextjs` package
   - Clerk dynamically injects `<script>` tags via React
   - We don't control the script tags they create
   - SRI hashes would break whenever Clerk updates their services

2. **Stripe Hosted Checkout**:
   - App uses Stripe's hosted checkout (redirects to `checkout.stripe.com`)
   - No Stripe.js scripts loaded in our frontend
   - Stripe handles all payment processing on their secure domain

3. **Dynamic Service Updates**:
   - Third-party services (Clerk, Cloudflare) update scripts frequently
   - Hardcoded SRI hashes would cause breakage
   - Services use their own security mechanisms (signed requests, HTTPS)

**Security Mitigations in Place**:
- ‚úÖ CSP restricts scripts to specific trusted domains only
- ‚úÖ All scripts loaded over HTTPS with HSTS enforcement
- ‚úÖ No broad `https:` wildcards in CSP (explicit domain allowlist)
- ‚úÖ All cookies secured with Secure flags

**For Future Manual Scripts**:
- Use `SecureScript` component (`components/SecureScript.tsx`)
- Generate SRI hashes: `curl URL | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A`
- See: `docs/SRI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

#### 2. Observatory Grade Expectations
**Expected Grade**: A- to B+

Mozilla Observatory may show warnings for:
- "SRI not implemented, but all external scripts are loaded over HTTPS" (expected)
- Possibly some Clerk test mode behaviors (if using test keys)

**This is normal for production Next.js applications** that use:
- Official third-party authentication packages (Clerk, Auth0, NextAuth)
- Payment processing services (Stripe, PayPal)
- Modern React frameworks (Next.js, Remix, Gatsby)

## Security Architecture

### Defense-in-Depth Approach

**Layer 1 - Transport Security**:
- HTTPS enforced via HSTS
- No HTTP fallback possible
- Certificate validation required

**Layer 2 - Content Security**:
- CSP restricts script origins
- Nonces for inline scripts
- No unsafe-eval allowed

**Layer 3 - Cookie Security**:
- Secure flag enforced
- HttpOnly prevents XSS theft
- SameSite prevents CSRF

**Layer 4 - Header Security**:
- Clickjacking prevention (X-Frame-Options)
- MIME-sniffing blocked (X-Content-Type-Options)
- Feature restrictions (Permissions-Policy)

**Layer 5 - Authentication Security**:
- Clerk enterprise-grade authentication
- JWT-based sessions with automatic refresh
- Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://labelcheck.io | grep -E "(Strict-Transport|Content-Security|X-Frame|X-Content)"
```

### 2. Test Cookie Security
```bash
# Sign in and inspect cookies in browser DevTools
# All cookies should show: Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite
```

### 3. Mozilla Observatory Scan
```bash
# Visit: https://observatory.mozilla.org/
# Scan: https://labelcheck.io
# Expected: A- to B+ grade
```

### 4. Security Headers Analysis
```bash
# Visit: https://securityheaders.com/
# Scan: https://labelcheck.io
# Expected: A or A+ grade
```
