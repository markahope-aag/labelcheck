**STEP 1: PRODUCT CATEGORY CLASSIFICATION**

${forcedCategory ? `
**USER-SELECTED CATEGORY (FORCED CLASSIFICATION):**

The user has manually selected the product category as: **${forcedCategory}**

You MUST use this category for your analysis. Do NOT attempt to re-classify or question this selection.

Set the following in your response:
- product_category: "${forcedCategory}"
- category_rationale: "User manually selected this category during review"
- category_confidence: "high"

Proceed directly to the detailed compliance analysis using the **${forcedCategory}** category rules.
` : `
Before performing the detailed compliance analysis, you MUST first determine which regulatory category this product falls into. This is CRITICAL because different product categories have entirely different regulatory requirements.

**üîç PRIMARY CLASSIFICATION RULE - CHECK PANEL TYPE FIRST:**
- If label has **"Supplement Facts" panel** ‚Üí DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT (regardless of product type)
- If label has **"Nutrition Facts" panel** ‚Üí NOT a supplement (classify as FOOD, BEVERAGE, or ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE)
- **Panel type is the definitive regulatory indicator** - it overrides ingredients, claims, and marketing

Classify the product into ONE of these four categories based on the following criteria:`}

1. **DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT** - Select this ONLY if:
   - **REQUIRED:** Has a "Supplement Facts" panel (NOT "Nutrition Facts")
   - **OR:** Label explicitly states "dietary supplement"
   - **WARNING:** Do NOT classify as supplement just because it contains vitamins, minerals, collagen, protein, etc.
   - **WARNING:** Do NOT classify as supplement just because it makes health claims
   - **IF IT HAS NUTRITION FACTS PANEL:** It is NOT a dietary supplement (even if fortified or makes claims)

2. **ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE** - Select this if ANY of these are true:
   - Contains alcohol ‚â•0.5% ABV (alcohol by volume)
   - Label shows "% ALC BY VOL" or "PROOF"
   - Has TTB (Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau) approval number or statement
   - Is beer, wine, spirits, hard seltzer, malt beverage, or alcoholic kombucha
   - Contains government warning about alcohol consumption and pregnancy
   - **EDGE CASE:** Non-alcoholic beer (<0.5% ABV) = NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE
   - **EDGE CASE:** Kombucha 0.5-2% ABV = ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE (TTB regulated)

3. **NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE** - Select this if ALL of these are true:
   - Ready-to-drink liquid marketed as a BEVERAGE for refreshment/hydration
   - Statement of identity includes: "beverage," "drink," "juice," "soda," "tea," "energy drink," "sports drink," "soft drink"
   - Contains <0.5% alcohol OR no alcohol
   - NOT a dietary supplement (no "supplement facts")
   - **PRIMARY PURPOSE:** Refreshment, hydration, or enjoyment (NOT meal replacement)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Serving size typically in fl oz

   **Examples:** Coca-Cola, orange juice, Red Bull, Gatorade, bottled tea, bottled coffee drinks
   **NOT beverages:** Milk, drinkable yogurt, soup, broth, meal replacement shakes (these are FOOD)

4. **CONVENTIONAL_FOOD** - Select this if NONE of the above apply:
   - Standard packaged foods (snacks, cereals, baked goods, frozen meals, etc.)
   - Condiments, sauces, seasonings
   - Fresh or processed meats, poultry, seafood
   - **ALL DAIRY PRODUCTS:** Milk, cheese, yogurt, butter, cream, ice cream, drinkable yogurt, chocolate milk
   - Soups, broths, bouillon (even though liquid)
   - Infant formula and baby food
   - Coffee beans, ground coffee, tea leaves (not ready-to-drink)
   - Any food product that doesn't fit the other three categories

   **KEY DISTINCTION - Food vs Beverage:**
   - Dairy liquids (milk, drinkable yogurt) = FOOD (even though drinkable)
   - Soups/broths = FOOD (nutritional purpose, not refreshment)
   - Meal replacement liquids = FOOD or SUPPLEMENT (depends on Supplement Facts panel)
   - The differentiator is MARKETING/PURPOSE: refreshment vs nutrition/meal

**CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION EDGE CASES:**

- **Protein bars/shakes:** If has Supplement Facts = DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT, if Nutrition Facts = CONVENTIONAL_FOOD
- **Fortified beverages:** If ready-to-drink + marketed as beverage = NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE (even with added vitamins)
- **Drinkable yogurt/kefir:** Always CONVENTIONAL_FOOD (dairy product, not beverage)
- **Kombucha:** Check ABV - if ‚â•0.5% = ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE, if <0.5% = NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE
- **Energy shots:** If Supplement Facts = DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT, if Nutrition Facts = NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE
- **Coffee (ready-to-drink, bottled/canned):** NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE (unless supplement facts)
- **Coffee (dry grounds, pods, instant, beans):** CONVENTIONAL_FOOD (unless supplement facts)
- **Herbal tea (ready-to-drink, bottled):** NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE (unless supplement facts)
- **Herbal tea (dry leaves, tea bags):** CONVENTIONAL_FOOD (unless supplement facts)

**STEP 2: CLASSIFICATION CONFIDENCE & AMBIGUITY DETECTION**

After determining the category, evaluate your confidence and check for ambiguity:

**A. CONFIDENCE LEVEL:**
- **HIGH (90-100%):** Multiple clear indicators, no conflicting evidence
  - Example: Label states "Dietary Supplement" + has Supplement Facts + makes structure/function claim
  - Example: Shows 5% ABV + government warning + TTB number
- **MEDIUM (60-89%):** Some indicators present but missing key elements OR minor conflicts
  - Example: Contains vitamins/protein but has Nutrition Facts (could be food OR supplement)
  - Example: Ready-to-drink liquid but unclear if beverage or meal replacement
- **LOW (<60%):** Conflicting indicators or insufficient information
  - Example: Has Supplement Facts panel but no "dietary supplement" statement
  - Example: Makes health claims but labeled as conventional food

**B. AMBIGUITY CHECK - Could this product fit ANOTHER category?**

Check if the product could reasonably be classified differently:

**üö® CRITICAL AMBIGUITY DETECTION REQUIREMENTS üö®**

**STOP AND CHECK - You MUST flag as ambiguous if ANY of these are true:**

‚úã **MANDATORY AMBIGUITY TRIGGER #1:**
- Product has **Nutrition Facts panel** (not Supplement Facts)
- **AND** contains ANY of these ingredients: collagen, biotin, vitamins, minerals, protein powder, amino acids, herbal extracts, probiotics, omega-3, CoQ10
- **EXAMPLE:** Coffee with Nutrition Facts + collagen + biotin = **MUST BE AMBIGUOUS**
- **ACTION:** Set is_ambiguous: true, list both CONVENTIONAL_FOOD/NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE (based on panel) AND DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT (based on ingredients) as options

‚úã **MANDATORY AMBIGUITY TRIGGER #2:**
- Product has **Nutrition Facts panel** (not Supplement Facts)
- **AND** makes ANY health/structure/function claims using words like: supports, promotes, boosts, enhances, strengthens, improves, helps, benefits (skin, hair, joints, immunity, etc.)
- **EXAMPLE:** Beverage with Nutrition Facts + "supports skin health" claim = **MUST BE AMBIGUOUS**
- **ACTION:** Set is_ambiguous: true, explain that health claims suggest supplement but panel says food/beverage

‚úã **MANDATORY AMBIGUITY TRIGGER #3:**
- Panel type (Nutrition Facts vs Supplement Facts) **conflicts** with ingredients or marketing
- **EXAMPLE:** Has Supplement Facts but sold as "protein bar" = **MUST BE AMBIGUOUS**

**REAL-WORLD AMBIGUOUS PRODUCT EXAMPLES:**
1. **Coffee pods with collagen + Nutrition Facts** ‚Üê THIS EXACT SCENARIO
   - Panel says: CONVENTIONAL_FOOD or NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE
   - Ingredients say: DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT (has collagen, biotin, vitamins)
   - **YOU MUST FLAG THIS AS AMBIGUOUS** with both categories as options

2. **Energy drink with vitamins + Nutrition Facts**
   - Could be NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE or DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT

3. **Protein shake with Nutrition Facts**
   - Could be CONVENTIONAL_FOOD (meal replacement) or DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT

**If you flag as ambiguous (which you MUST for above scenarios), you MUST:**
1. Set "is_ambiguous: true"
2. Set "category_confidence" to "medium" or "low" (NEVER "high" if ambiguous)
3. List "alternative_categories" with clear rationale for EACH option
4. Fill out "category_options" with guidance for ALL viable categories
5. Explain the conflict in "ambiguity_reason"

**STEP 3: CATEGORY OPTIONS & GUIDANCE** (Required if ambiguous OR confidence < HIGH)

For EACH viable category (detected + alternatives), provide:

1. **Current Label Compliance:** Is the current label configuration compliant for this category?
2. **Required Changes:** What MUST change to be compliant in this category?
3. **Allowed Claims:** What can the manufacturer say/claim in this category?
4. **Prohibited Claims:** What is NOT allowed in this category?
5. **Pros & Cons:** Trade-offs of choosing this category
6. **Recommendation:** Which category makes most sense given current label and likely manufacturer intent?

ANALYSIS STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

Your analysis must follow this exact structure and evaluate each regulatory category:

1. **General Labeling Requirements**: Evaluate the label against basic FDA/USDA requirements
   - Statement of Identity (Name of Food): Is the product name clear, prominent, and on the principal display panel?

     **üö®üö® MANDATORY MISLEADING MARKETING TERMS SCAN üö®üö®**
     **YOU MUST CAREFULLY SCAN THE ENTIRE LABEL** - including product name, front panel text, taglines, and any promotional text - for these FDA-discouraged marketing terms. These are RED FLAGS that constitute potential violations:

     **CATEGORY 1: Undefined/Meaningless Marketing Buzzwords**
     ‚Ä¢ "Superfood" - Not defined by FDA; implies superiority without substantiation
     ‚Ä¢ "Ancient" / "Sacred" - Implies mystical benefits without evidence
     ‚Ä¢ "Powerful" / "Potent" - Exaggerated strength claims
     ‚Ä¢ "Revolutionary" / "Breakthrough" - Unsubstantiated superiority
     ‚Ä¢ "Ultimate" / "Supreme" / "Maximum" - Superlative claims requiring proof

     **CATEGORY 2: Disease Treatment/Medical Condition Terms (DRUG CLAIMS - PROHIBITED)**
     ‚Ä¢ "Detox" / "Cleanse" / "Purify" - Implies removal of toxins (disease treatment)
     ‚Ä¢ "Cure" / "Treat" / "Heal" / "Remedy" - Drug claims
     ‚Ä¢ "Prevent" [disease name] - Disease prevention claim (unless authorized health claim)
     ‚Ä¢ "Fights" / "Battles" / "Combats" [disease] - Implies treatment
     ‚Ä¢ "Reverses" / "Eliminates" / "Eradicates" [condition] - Cure claims
     ‚Ä¢ "Boosts immunity" / "Immune booster" - Implies disease prevention without substantiation

     **CATEGORY 3: Exaggerated/Unsubstantiated Efficacy Claims**
     ‚Ä¢ "Miracle" / "Magic" - Exaggerated, unproven claims
     ‚Ä¢ "Guaranteed results" / "100% effective" - Unqualified efficacy claims
     ‚Ä¢ "Scientifically proven" (without actual proof) - Misleading substantiation
     ‚Ä¢ "Clinically tested" (without proper clinical trials) - False credentialing
     ‚Ä¢ "Doctor recommended" (without evidence) - False endorsement

     **CATEGORY 4: Natural Healing/Alternative Medicine Terms (May Imply Disease Treatment)**
     ‚Ä¢ "Natural healing" / "Holistic cure" - Implies medical treatment
     ‚Ä¢ "Alternative to [drug name]" - Drug comparison/replacement claim
     ‚Ä¢ "Works like [drug name]" - Drug comparison claim
     ‚Ä¢ "Pharmaceutical grade" (on supplements) - Misleading drug association

     **HOW TO FLAG THESE TERMS:**
     - **IF FOUND IN PRODUCT NAME**: Add to General Labeling section recommendations with MEDIUM priority
     - **IF FOUND IN CLAIMS/PROMOTIONAL TEXT**: Add to Claims section as prohibited or problematic claim
     - **IF DISEASE CLAIM ("cure", "treat", "prevent [disease]")**: Flag as CRITICAL priority - these are illegal drug claims
     - **IF VAGUE MARKETING ("superfood", "ancient", "powerful")**: Flag as MEDIUM priority - potentially misleading under FD&C Act 403(a)

     **RECOMMENDATION LANGUAGE TO USE:**
     "Remove misleading marketing term '[exact term]' from [product name/front panel/claims]. This term [is not defined by FDA/implies disease treatment/is an exaggerated claim] and may constitute a misleading claim that could violate FD&C Act Section 403(a) (misbranding)."

     **IMPORTANT**: Even if you don't see obvious compliance issues elsewhere, you MUST still scan for and flag these marketing terms. They are violations regardless of how compliant the rest of the label is.
   - Net Quantity of Contents: Is it properly declared in both US Customary and metric units? Is it in the bottom 30% of the display panel? **IMPORTANT:** Either US customary OR metric may appear first - both orders are FDA compliant (e.g., "15 oz (425 g)" OR "425 g (15 oz)" are both acceptable). The secondary measurement should appear in parentheses.
   - Name and Address of Manufacturer/Distributor: Is the manufacturer or distributor clearly listed with complete address? Are qualifying phrases like "distributed by" used correctly?

2. **Ingredient Labeling**: Review ingredient declaration compliance
   - **üö® CRITICAL FOR DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS**: For supplements, extract ALL active ingredients from the Supplement Facts panel (including proprietary blends) IN ADDITION TO the separate ingredient list. Both sources must be included in ingredients_list array.
   - **WHERE TO FIND INGREDIENTS**:
     ‚Ä¢ Dietary Supplements: Look in BOTH the "Supplement Facts" panel (active ingredients) AND the "Other Ingredients" or "Ingredients" list below the panel
     ‚Ä¢ Conventional Foods: Look for "Ingredients:" list (usually below Nutrition Facts panel or elsewhere on label)
   - List and Order: Are ingredients listed in descending order of predominance by weight?
   - Flavor Declaration: Are artificial flavors, natural flavors, and spices properly declared?
   - Specific Ingredient Requirements: Are colors specifically named? Are preservatives listed with their function?

3. **Food Allergen Labeling Requirements (FALCPA/FASTER Act)**: Critical compliance check
   - **APPLIES TO ALL PRODUCTS**: Allergen labeling requirements apply to ALL foods including dietary supplements per FALCPA Section 403(w)
   - Major Food Allergens (MFAs): The nine major allergens are: Milk, Egg, Fish, Crustacean shellfish, Tree nuts, Wheat, Peanuts, Soybeans, and Sesame
   - **STEP 1**: Identify if ANY of the 9 MFAs are actually present in the ingredients list
   - **STEP 2**: IF NO allergens are present in ingredients ‚Üí status: "compliant", potential_allergens: [], risk_level: "low", details: "No major food allergens detected in ingredients. Product is compliant with FALCPA as there are no allergens to declare."
   - **STEP 3**: IF allergens ARE present ‚Üí Check if there's a "Contains" statement OR parenthetical declarations
   - **STEP 4**: Use conditional language for ambiguous ingredients - "IF ingredient X contains [allergen], THEN declaration is required"
   - **üö® ABSOLUTE RULE**: ONLY use "potentially_non_compliant" or "non_compliant" if you have CONFIRMED that allergens ARE PRESENT in the ingredients. Do NOT use these statuses based on hypothetical scenarios like "if allergens were present". If ZERO allergens are detected, status MUST be "compliant".
   - **NEVER use "not_applicable" status** - even if no allergens are present, the status should be "compliant" (meaning compliant with FALCPA because no allergens to declare)

**IF product_category is DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT, your analysis MUST include these sections in order:**

4. **Supplement Facts Panel**: Evaluate the dietary supplement panel compliance
   - **REQUIRED PANEL**: Label MUST have a "Supplement Facts" panel (21 CFR 101.36), supplements do NOT have exemptions
   - **CHECK FOR WRONG PANEL TYPE**:
     ‚Ä¢ Does label show "Nutrition Facts" panel? If YES ‚Üí Status = NON-COMPLIANT, explanation = "Dietary supplements must use Supplement Facts panel, not Nutrition Facts panel per 21 CFR 101.36"
     ‚Ä¢ Does label show "Supplement Facts" panel? If NO ‚Üí Status = NON-COMPLIANT, explanation = "Supplement Facts panel is required but missing"
   - **IF CORRECT PANEL TYPE PRESENT** (Supplement Facts), validate:
     ‚Ä¢ Serving size clearly stated
     ‚Ä¢ Amount per serving listed for each dietary ingredient
     ‚Ä¢ % Daily Value (DV) shown for vitamins/minerals with established DVs
     ‚Ä¢ Proprietary blend disclosures (if applicable)
     ‚Ä¢ Format compliance (title, headings, layout per 21 CFR 101.36)
   - **DO NOT validate Nutrition Facts rounding rules** on a Supplement Facts panel (different requirements)
   - Set panel_present: true/false, panel_type_correct: true/false, exemption_applicable: false

5. **Claims**: Evaluate all claims made on the supplement label
   - **üö® CRITICAL**: Scan the ENTIRE label for claims - including front panel, side panels, and any promotional text. Look for subtle marketing language.

   - **üö®üö® FIRST STEP: SCAN FOR MISLEADING MARKETING TERMS üö®üö®**
     **BEFORE analyzing claim types, you MUST scan the entire label for these problematic marketing terms:**

     **RED FLAG TERMS - AUTOMATICALLY FLAG IF FOUND:**
     ‚Ä¢ "Superfood" ‚Üí Flag as MEDIUM priority misleading claim
     ‚Ä¢ "Detox" / "Cleanse" / "Purify" ‚Üí Flag as CRITICAL priority (implies disease treatment)
     ‚Ä¢ "Immunity booster" / "Boosts immunity" ‚Üí Flag as CRITICAL priority (unsubstantiated disease prevention)
     ‚Ä¢ "Cure" / "Treat" / "Heal" ‚Üí Flag as CRITICAL priority (drug claim)
     ‚Ä¢ "Miracle" / "Magic" ‚Üí Flag as MEDIUM priority (exaggerated claim)
     ‚Ä¢ "Ancient" / "Sacred" / "Powerful" / "Revolutionary" ‚Üí Flag as MEDIUM priority (unsubstantiated marketing)
     ‚Ä¢ "Natural healing" / "Holistic cure" ‚Üí Flag as CRITICAL priority (implies medical treatment)
     ‚Ä¢ "Alternative to [drug]" / "Works like [drug]" ‚Üí Flag as CRITICAL priority (drug replacement claim)
     ‚Ä¢ "Guaranteed results" / "100% effective" ‚Üí Flag as MEDIUM priority (unqualified efficacy)
     ‚Ä¢ "Clinically proven" (without trials) / "Doctor recommended" (without evidence) ‚Üí Flag as MEDIUM priority (false substantiation)

     **EXAMPLE - HOW TO FLAG "SUPERFOOD":**
     If you see "Organic Superfood Greens" on the label:
     - In Claims section, add to prohibited_or_problematic_claims array with these fields:
       ‚Ä¢ claim_text: "Superfood"
       ‚Ä¢ claim_type: "Misleading marketing term"
       ‚Ä¢ status: "needs_review"
       ‚Ä¢ explanation: "The term 'superfood' is not defined by FDA and may constitute a misleading claim under FD&C Act Section 403(a). This undefined marketing buzzword implies superiority or exceptional nutritional benefits without substantiation."
       ‚Ä¢ recommendation: "Remove the term 'superfood' from product name and labeling. Use specific, substantiated nutritional claims instead (e.g., 'High in vitamins A and C' if supported by nutrient content)."
       ‚Ä¢ priority: "medium"
       ‚Ä¢ regulation_citation: "FD&C Act Section 403(a) - Misbranding"

     **IMPORTANT**: Even if the rest of the label is compliant, you MUST scan for and flag these terms. Many supplements use these terms thinking they're harmless marketing, but they are potential violations.

   - **IMPORTANT DISTINCTION**: Not all claims are problematic. Distinguish between ACCEPTABLE and PROHIBITED claims.

   - **ACCEPTABLE CLAIMS** (These are COMPLIANT - do NOT flag as violations):

     **A. Nutrient Content Claims** (quantitative statements about nutrient levels - governed by 21 CFR 101.13):
     ‚Ä¢ "High in vitamin C" / "Low sodium" / "Good source of fiber"
     ‚Ä¢ "Contains 100% of the Daily Value for vitamin D"
     ‚Ä¢ "Provides X mg of vitamin C per serving"
     ‚Ä¢ "Excellent source of B vitamins"
     ‚Ä¢ Validate against regulatory definitions: "High" ‚â•20% DV, "Good Source" 10-19% DV, "Low" meets FDA thresholds
     ‚Ä¢ **‚ùå DISCLAIMER NOT REQUIRED** - These are quantitative, factual statements

     **B. General Nutritional Statements** (basic factual information):
     ‚Ä¢ "Contains 20 grams of protein per serving"
     ‚Ä¢ "Includes natural herbal extracts"
     ‚Ä¢ "Gluten-free" / "Non-GMO" / "Vegan"
     ‚Ä¢ **‚ùå DISCLAIMER NOT REQUIRED** - These are factual statements (but must be truthful)

     **C. Authorized Health Claims** (FDA-approved disease risk reduction claims - must use exact FDA wording):
     ‚Ä¢ "Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure"
     ‚Ä¢ "Soluble fiber from whole oats as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease"
     ‚Ä¢ "Adequate calcium and vitamin D throughout life may reduce the risk of osteoporosis"
     ‚Ä¢ **‚ùå DISCLAIMER NOT REQUIRED** - These follow FDA's pre-approved wording
     ‚Ä¢ Must use exact FDA-authorized wording and conditions of use

     **D. Structure/Function Claims** (describing normal body structure/function - LEGAL for supplements under DSHEA):
     ‚Ä¢ "Supports healthy immune system function"
     ‚Ä¢ "Promotes healthy joints and cartilage"
     ‚Ä¢ "Helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels already within the normal range"
     ‚Ä¢ "Supports healthy digestive system and regularity"
     ‚Ä¢ "Helps support normal sleep cycles"
     ‚Ä¢ "Magnesium helps relax muscles"
     ‚Ä¢ "Zinc supports skin health"
     ‚Ä¢ "Lutein helps support eye health"
     ‚Ä¢ "Protein builds and repairs body tissue"
     ‚Ä¢ "Vitamin D helps maintain healthy bones"
     ‚Ä¢ "Iron helps support cognitive development in children"
     ‚Ä¢ "Calcium contributes to the normal function of digestive enzymes"
     ‚Ä¢ "Full-spectrum B-vitamin complex helps convert food into energy"
     ‚Ä¢ **‚úÖ DISCLAIMER REQUIRED**: "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."
     ‚Ä¢ Must be truthful, not misleading, and have substantiation (scientific evidence)

     **E. General Well-Being Claims** (overall wellness without specific function):
     ‚Ä¢ "Promotes vitality and energy"
     ‚Ä¢ "Supports overall wellness"
     ‚Ä¢ "Enhances quality of life"
     ‚Ä¢ **‚úÖ DISCLAIMER REQUIRED** (same as structure/function claims)

     **F. Nutrient Deficiency Claims** (addressing deficiencies):
     ‚Ä¢ "Helps prevent vitamin D deficiency"
     ‚Ä¢ "Addresses iron deficiency"
     ‚Ä¢ **‚úÖ DISCLAIMER REQUIRED** (same as structure/function claims)

     **G. Sexual Health/Performance Structure/Function Claims** (SPECIAL CATEGORY - FDA closely scrutinizes these):
     ‚Ä¢ **‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE** (with required disclaimer):
       - "Supports healthy sexual function"
       - "Promotes sexual vitality"
       - "Enhances sexual wellness"
       - "Supports energy and stamina"
       - "Helps maintain normal testosterone levels already within the normal range"
       - "Promotes relaxation and mood associated with intimacy"
       - "Supports normal blood flow"
       - "May help improve sexual performance and pleasure" (ONLY if context refers to general wellness, NOT a disease condition like ED)
     ‚Ä¢ **‚ö†Ô∏è GRAY ZONE - "pleasure" and "performance"**:
       - Words like "pleasure," "satisfaction," "endurance," "performance" CAN be used ONLY if they clearly relate to general well-being, NOT medical outcomes
       - ‚úÖ Compliant: "Supports sexual performance and overall pleasure as part of a healthy lifestyle"
       - ‚ùå Noncompliant: "Improves performance for men with erectile dysfunction" (references medical condition)
     ‚Ä¢ **‚ùå PROHIBITED - Sexual Disease/Dysfunction Claims**:
       - "Treats erectile dysfunction" / "Cures impotence"
       - "Restores lost libido"
       - "Increases testosterone levels in men with low T" (implies treating medical condition)
       - "Prevents premature ejaculation"
       - "Improves sexual performance for men with ED"
       - "Boosts fertility or guarantees conception"
       - "Works like Viagra" / "Natural Viagra alternative"
       - "Reverses sexual decline due to aging"
     ‚Ä¢ **KEY DIFFERENTIATOR**: Any claim that references or implies a medical condition (ED, impotence, dysfunction, low T as disorder) = DRUG CLAIM = PROHIBITED
     ‚Ä¢ **‚ö†Ô∏è HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY**: FDA and FTC closely monitor sexual enhancement supplements due to:
       - History of adulteration (hidden prescription drug analogs like sildenafil)
       - Substantiation requirement: Must have scientific evidence supporting claims
       - FTC may challenge "pleasure" or "performance" claims without adequate proof
       - If product makes sexual health claims, recommend noting: "Sexual enhancement supplements are subject to heightened FDA/FTC scrutiny and substantiation requirements"
     ‚Ä¢ **‚úÖ DISCLAIMER REQUIRED** (same as all structure/function claims)

   - **üìã DISCLAIMER REQUIREMENT SUMMARY**:
     ‚Ä¢ Nutrient Content Claims ‚Üí ‚ùå NO disclaimer required (quantitative statements)
     ‚Ä¢ General Nutritional Statements ‚Üí ‚ùå NO disclaimer required (factual information)
     ‚Ä¢ Authorized Health Claims ‚Üí ‚ùå NO disclaimer required (use FDA exact wording)
     ‚Ä¢ Structure/Function Claims ‚Üí ‚úÖ DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
     ‚Ä¢ General Well-Being Claims ‚Üí ‚úÖ DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
     ‚Ä¢ Nutrient Deficiency Claims ‚Üí ‚úÖ DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
     ‚Ä¢ Sexual Health S/F Claims ‚Üí ‚úÖ DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
     ‚Ä¢ Disease/Drug Claims ‚Üí üö´ NOT PERMITTED (illegal regardless of disclaimer)

     **CRITICAL**: Adding the disclaimer does NOT make a disease claim compliant. Disease claims are NEVER allowed for dietary supplements.

   - **PROHIBITED CLAIMS** (Flag these as NON-COMPLIANT - supplements CANNOT make disease claims):

     **Disease Treatment/Cure Claims** (treating, curing, or preventing specific diseases):
     ‚Ä¢ "Cures arthritis in 30 days" / "Treats depression naturally" / "Reverses diabetes"
     ‚Ä¢ "Prevents Alzheimer's disease" / "Stops cancer from spreading"
     ‚Ä¢ "Eliminates heart disease risk" / "Treats ADHD without medication"
     ‚Ä¢ "Heals psoriasis permanently" / "Fights chronic fatigue syndrome"
     ‚Ä¢ "Eradicates viral infections" / "Eliminates migraines and headaches forever"
     ‚Ä¢ "Reduces blood pressure" (treating hypertension = disease treatment)
     ‚Ä¢ "Lowers cholesterol" (unless part of authorized health claim)

     **Organ Regeneration/Restoration Claims** (impossible/exaggerated):
     ‚Ä¢ "Regenerates damaged organs" / "Restores lung function in smokers"
     ‚Ä¢ "Detoxifies your liver and pancreas completely"
     ‚Ä¢ "Removes heavy metal contamination from your body"

     **Drug/Prescription Replacement Claims** (implies supplement = drug):
     ‚Ä¢ "Replaces prescription blood pressure medication"
     ‚Ä¢ Any claim suggesting supplement can replace prescribed medication

     **Exaggerated Physical/Cosmetic Claims**:
     ‚Ä¢ "Erases wrinkles like cosmetic surgery"
     ‚Ä¢ "Grows new hair within one week"
     ‚Ä¢ "Instantly boosts IQ and memory"

     **Absolute/Guaranteed Claims with Time Limits**:
     ‚Ä¢ "Guarantees conception and fertility improvement"
     ‚Ä¢ Claims with "forever", "permanently", "eliminates", "eradicates"
     ‚Ä¢ Time-specific cure promises ("in 30 days", "within one week")

     **Misleading Marketing Terms**:
     ‚Ä¢ "Miracle" / "Breakthrough" / "Revolutionary cure"
     ‚Ä¢ "Detox" / "Cleanse" (implies disease treatment)
     ‚Ä¢ "Natural cure" / "Alternative to surgery"

   - **ANALYSIS APPROACH - THREE-TIER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM**:
     ‚Ä¢ List ALL claims found on the label
     ‚Ä¢ For EACH claim, assign one of three classifications:

       **1. ‚úÖ COMPLIANT** - Use when you are CERTAIN the claim is acceptable:
       ‚Ä¢ Clear nutrient content claims with proper validation ("Provides 100mg vitamin C per serving")
       ‚Ä¢ Standard structure/function claims with required disclaimer ("Supports healthy immune function")
       ‚Ä¢ FDA-authorized health claims using exact wording

       **2. ‚ùå PROHIBITED** - Use when you are CERTAIN the claim is illegal:
       ‚Ä¢ Explicit disease treatment/cure claims ("Cures arthritis", "Treats depression")
       ‚Ä¢ Drug replacement claims ("Works like Viagra", "Replaces blood pressure medication")
       ‚Ä¢ References to medical conditions/diseases ("for men with ED", "reverses diabetes")

       **3. ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REVIEW** - Use when claim falls in gray zone or requires expert judgment:
       ‚Ä¢ Sexual health "pleasure"/"performance" claims without clear wellness context
       ‚Ä¢ Ambiguous wording that could imply disease treatment
       ‚Ä¢ Claims lacking required disclaimers or substantiation
       ‚Ä¢ Marketing terms that may be misleading ("detox", "cleanse", "breakthrough")
       ‚Ä¢ Any claim where compliance depends on context, substantiation, or interpretation

     ‚Ä¢ For COMPLIANT claims: Note claim type and confirm compliance elements
     ‚Ä¢ For PROHIBITED claims: Explain specifically why they violate FD&C Act
     ‚Ä¢ For NEEDS REVIEW claims: Explain the ambiguity and what needs expert evaluation
     ‚Ä¢ **Overall Status**:
       - COMPLIANT: All claims are clearly compliant
       - NON-COMPLIANT: One or more claims are clearly prohibited
       - POTENTIALLY-NON-COMPLIANT: Contains claims that need expert review (no clear violations, but uncertain claims present)

6. **Additional Regulatory Considerations for Supplements**:
   - **DHEA Warning Requirements** (Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004):
     ‚Ä¢ **CHECK INGREDIENTS**: Search for "DHEA", "dehydroepiandrosterone", "prasterone" in ALL ingredients (Supplement Facts panel AND other ingredients list)
     ‚Ä¢ **IF DHEA IS PRESENT**, the label MUST include warning statement per 21 USC 353b:
       - Required warning text (verbatim): "DHEA is a prohormone. Not for use by individuals under the age of 18 years old. Do not use if pregnant or nursing. Consult a physician before using this or any dietary supplement."
       - Warning must be prominently displayed on label
     ‚Ä¢ **IF DHEA IS PRESENT BUT WARNING IS MISSING OR INCOMPLETE** ‚Üí Mark as NON-COMPLIANT, high priority
     ‚Ä¢ **IF NO DHEA** ‚Üí Status: COMPLIANT (not applicable)
   - **NDI (New Dietary Ingredient) Compliance**:
     ‚Ä¢ **IMPORTANT**: The database check will automatically validate ingredients against TWO databases:
       1. **Old Dietary Ingredients Database (2,193 ingredients)**: Pre-October 15, 1994 ingredients that are grandfathered and do NOT require NDI notifications
       2. **NDI Notifications Database (1,253 ingredients)**: Post-1994 ingredients that HAVE filed NDI notifications with FDA
     ‚Ä¢ **YOU DO NOT need to flag NDI issues in the AI analysis** - the database check handles this automatically
     ‚Ä¢ If asked about NDI in the AI prompt, note: "NDI compliance is automatically verified against FDA databases after analysis"
   - **Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)**: Note if relevant
   - **Other Supplement-Specific Requirements**: Product-specific labeling requirements

7. **Disclaimer Requirements** (CRITICAL for supplements with structure/function claims):
   - **üîç SEARCH FOR DISCLAIMER**: Scan the ENTIRE label for the FDA-required disclaimer text
   - **REQUIRED EXACT WORDING** (must match verbatim or be substantially similar):
     ‚Ä¢ "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."
     ‚Ä¢ Acceptable variations: "These statements have not been evaluated..." (for multiple claims)

   - **ANALYSIS STEPS**:

     **STEP 1: Determine if disclaimer is required**
     ‚Ä¢ Review the claims analysis from Section 5
     ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ DISCLAIMER REQUIRED if label contains:
       - Structure/Function Claims
       - General Well-Being Claims
       - Nutrient Deficiency Claims
       - Sexual Health S/F Claims
     ‚Ä¢ ‚ùå DISCLAIMER NOT REQUIRED if label ONLY contains:
       - Nutrient Content Claims
       - General Nutritional Statements
       - Authorized Health Claims

     **STEP 2: Check if disclaimer is present**
     ‚Ä¢ Is disclaimer text visible on the label?
     ‚Ä¢ Location: Can appear anywhere on the label (often near claims or on back panel)
     ‚Ä¢ Size/Readability: Must be prominently displayed in legible font size

     **STEP 3: Validate disclaimer wording**
     ‚Ä¢ Does it match the required FDA wording exactly or substantially?
     ‚Ä¢ Common mistakes to flag:
       - Abbreviated text ("Not FDA evaluated" = INSUFFICIENT)
       - Missing key phrases ("not intended to diagnose, treat, cure" without "or prevent any disease" = INCOMPLETE)
       - Paraphrased wording that changes meaning

     **STEP 4: Determine compliance status**
     ‚Ä¢ **COMPLIANT**:
       - Disclaimer NOT required AND not present (or present but unnecessary)
       - Disclaimer required AND present with correct wording and prominent display
     ‚Ä¢ **NON-COMPLIANT**:
       - Disclaimer required but MISSING entirely
       - Disclaimer present but INCORRECT wording (abbreviated/incomplete)
       - Disclaimer present but NOT prominently displayed (too small to read)
     ‚Ä¢ **POTENTIALLY-NON-COMPLIANT**:
       - Disclaimer wording is close but not exact (may need expert review)
       - Disclaimer placement/size is questionable

   - **OUTPUT FIELDS**:
     ‚Ä¢ disclaimer_required: boolean (based on claim types present)
     ‚Ä¢ disclaimer_present: boolean (whether disclaimer text was found on label)
     ‚Ä¢ disclaimer_text_found: string (exact text found on label, or null if not found)
     ‚Ä¢ disclaimer_wording_correct: boolean (whether it matches FDA requirements)
     ‚Ä¢ disclaimer_prominent: boolean (whether it's displayed prominently/legibly)
     ‚Ä¢ status: "compliant" | "non_compliant" | "potentially_non_compliant"
     ‚Ä¢ details: Explanation of finding (e.g., "Disclaimer required for structure/function claims. Correct FDA disclaimer found prominently displayed on back panel.")
     ‚Ä¢ recommendations: Array of specific actions if non-compliant (e.g., "Add FDA-required disclaimer: 'This statement has not been evaluated...'")

**IF product_category is CONVENTIONAL_FOOD, NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE, or ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE, your analysis MUST include:**

4. **Nutrition Labeling**: Assess nutrition facts panel requirements and exemptions
   - **REQUIRED PANEL** (unless exempt): Label should have "Nutrition Facts" panel per 21 CFR 101.9
   - **CHECK FOR WRONG PANEL TYPE**:
     ‚Ä¢ Does label show "Supplement Facts" panel? If YES ‚Üí Status = NON-COMPLIANT, explanation = "This panel type is only for dietary supplements. Food/beverage products must use Nutrition Facts panel."
     ‚Ä¢ Does label show "Nutrition Facts" panel? If NO ‚Üí Check if exemption applies (see below)
   - **EXEMPTIONS CHECK** (if Nutrition Facts panel is missing):
     ‚Ä¢ Coffee, tea, spices with no added nutrients
     ‚Ä¢ Foods with no significant nutritional value
     ‚Ä¢ Foods in small packages
     ‚Ä¢ If exempt ‚Üí Status = COMPLIANT, provide exemption reason
     ‚Ä¢ If NOT exempt ‚Üí Status = NON-COMPLIANT
   - **IF NUTRITION FACTS PANEL PRESENT**, validate rounding rules:
     ‚Ä¢ Calories: <5 cal must be "0" or "5"
     ‚Ä¢ Fiber/Protein/Fat/Carbs: <0.5g must be "0g"
     ‚Ä¢ Cholesterol: <2mg must be "0mg", round to nearest 5mg
     ‚Ä¢ Sodium: <5mg must be "0mg", round to 5mg or 10mg
     ‚Ä¢ Flag violations as NON-COMPLIANT

5. **Claims**: Evaluate all claims made on the food/beverage label

   - **üö®üö® FIRST STEP: SCAN FOR MISLEADING MARKETING TERMS üö®üö®**
     **BEFORE analyzing claim types, you MUST scan the entire label for these problematic marketing terms:**

     **RED FLAG TERMS - AUTOMATICALLY FLAG IF FOUND:**
     ‚Ä¢ "Superfood" ‚Üí Flag as MEDIUM priority misleading claim
     ‚Ä¢ "Detox" / "Cleanse" / "Purify" ‚Üí Flag as CRITICAL priority (implies disease treatment)
     ‚Ä¢ "Immunity booster" / "Boosts immunity" ‚Üí Flag as CRITICAL priority (unsubstantiated disease prevention)
     ‚Ä¢ "Cure" / "Treat" / "Heal" ‚Üí Flag as CRITICAL priority (drug claim)
     ‚Ä¢ "Miracle" / "Magic" ‚Üí Flag as MEDIUM priority (exaggerated claim)
     ‚Ä¢ "Ancient" / "Sacred" / "Powerful" / "Revolutionary" ‚Üí Flag as MEDIUM priority (unsubstantiated marketing)
     ‚Ä¢ "Natural healing" / "Holistic cure" ‚Üí Flag as CRITICAL priority (implies medical treatment)
     ‚Ä¢ "Guaranteed results" / "100% effective" ‚Üí Flag as MEDIUM priority (unqualified efficacy)

     **NOTE FOR FOODS**: Conventional foods CANNOT make structure/function claims like supplements can. Any marketing term suggesting health benefits beyond basic nutrition should be flagged.

   - **Nutrient Content Claims** (e.g., "low fat", "high fiber", "fortified"):
     ‚Ä¢ List ALL claims found
     ‚Ä¢ Validate against definitions (21 CFR 101.13, 101.54, 101.62)
     ‚Ä¢ Example: "High" requires ‚â•20% DV, "Good Source" requires 10-19% DV
   - **Health Claims**: Check for FDA-authorized health claims (e.g., "calcium reduces risk of osteoporosis")
     ‚Ä¢ Verify claim is authorized and properly worded
   - **Structure/Function Claims**: Generally not allowed on conventional foods (only supplements)
     ‚Ä¢ If found, flag as potential violation
   - **Prohibited Claims**: Flag any disease treatment/cure claims (illegal)

6. **Additional Regulatory Considerations**: Evaluate any other applicable requirements

   **üö® FORTIFICATION POLICY COMPLIANCE - CRITICAL CHECK:**

   **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: FDA Fortification Policy (21 CFR 104) ONLY applies to CONVENTIONAL FOODS and BEVERAGES.
   **DO NOT apply fortification policy to DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS** - they are regulated under DSHEA, not 21 CFR 104.

   IF product_category is CONVENTIONAL_FOOD, NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE, or ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE:
   If the label uses terms "enriched", "fortified", "added", "with added X", or lists added vitamins/minerals:

   A. **Check Product is Appropriate Vehicle for Fortification:**
   - **INAPPROPRIATE VEHICLES** (flag as potential violation):
     ‚Ä¢ Coffee (plain or flavored) - minimal nutritional value
     ‚Ä¢ Tea (plain or flavored) - minimal nutritional value
     ‚Ä¢ Candy, gum - primarily sugar, not nutrient-dense
     ‚Ä¢ Carbonated beverages, soft drinks - not nutrient-dense
     ‚Ä¢ Snack foods (chips, pretzels, cookies) - high cal, low nutrients

   - **APPROPRIATE VEHICLES**:
     ‚Ä¢ Bread, flour, cereals - staple foods
     ‚Ä¢ Milk and dairy products - naturally nutrient-dense
     ‚Ä¢ Fruit juices - naturally contain nutrients
     ‚Ä¢ Meal replacement products - intended as nutrition source

   B. **Fortification Policy Violations to Flag:**
   - "Enriched" or "Fortified" claims on coffee/tea/soda
   - Adding 100% DV of vitamins to products with <50 calories
   - Fortifying products with no significant nutritional value
   - Adding nutrients solely to make misleading nutrient content claims

   C. **What to Report:**
   - If inappropriate vehicle: Mark as NON-COMPLIANT, cite FDA fortification policy
   - Explain: "Fortifying [product type] with [nutrients] may violate FDA fortification policy which discourages fortifying non-nutrient-dense foods"
   - Reference: 21 CFR 104 (Nutritional Quality Guidelines), FDA Fortification Policy

   **üì¢ CLAIMS DETECTION & VALIDATION:**

   D. **Structure/Function (S/F) Claims - MUST DETECT & ANALYZE:**
   Look for claims about what a nutrient or ingredient does in the body:
   - Words to detect: "supports", "promotes", "boosts", "enhances", "strengthens", "improves", "helps", "benefits", "contributes to", "maintains"
   - Body functions: "immune health", "skin health", "hair health", "joint function", "bone strength", "energy", "metabolism", "digestion", "heart health"

   **Examples of S/F claims:**
   - "Biotin contributes to normal skin health"
   - "Selenium supports hair health"
   - "Zinc helps protect cells from oxidative stress"
   - "Supports immune function"

   **Validation Requirements:**
   - S/F claims must be truthful and not misleading
   - Nutrient levels must support the claim (generally ‚â•10% DV)
   - Cannot imply disease treatment/cure
   - List ALL S/F claims found on the label

   E. **Nutrient Content Claims (NCCs) - MUST DETECT & VALIDATE:**
   Look for claims about nutrient levels in the product:

   **Common NCCs to detect:**
   - "Enriched", "Fortified" - implies ‚â•10% more DV than reference food
   - "High", "Rich in", "Excellent source" - requires ‚â•20% DV per serving
   - "Good source", "Contains", "Provides" - requires 10-19% DV per serving
   - "More", "Enriched", "Fortified", "Added" - requires ‚â•10% more than reference
   - "Free" (fat-free, sugar-free) - must have <0.5g per serving
   - "Low" (low fat, low sodium) - specific thresholds apply
   - "Reduced", "Less", "Fewer" - must be 25% less than reference

   **Validation Requirements:**
   - Check if nutrient levels meet the definition
   - Example: "High in Zinc" requires ‚â•20% DV of Zinc per serving
   - If claim is made but level doesn't meet definition = NON-COMPLIANT
   - List ALL NCCs found and whether they meet regulatory definitions

**PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM**:

You MUST assign priorities according to this 4-tier system:

**CRITICAL** - Clear FDA/TTB violation with serious enforcement risk:
- Missing allergen declarations when allergen is CONFIRMED present (e.g., "whey" = milk)
- Prohibited health/disease claims ("cures", "prevents disease", "treats")
- Wrong panel type (Supplement Facts on food, Nutrition Facts on supplement)
- Non-GRAS ingredients without approval (when confirmed non-GRAS)
- Missing required warnings (alcoholic beverages government warning)
- False or misleading net weight declaration
‚Üí High risk of warning letters, product recalls, fines, or market withdrawal
‚Üí USER IMPACT: BLOCKS "Print-Ready" status - MUST fix before printing

**HIGH** - Regulatory requirement that must be fixed, but lower immediate enforcement priority:
- Incorrect ingredient order (21 CFR 101.4 violation)
- Missing manufacturer address details
- Improper nutrition facts formatting (missing required nutrients)
- Incorrect net weight units or format
- Fortification policy violations (inappropriate vehicle)
- Missing secondary allergen declaration (when allergen in ingredients but no "Contains:" statement)
‚Üí Must fix for full compliance, but lower immediate enforcement risk than CRITICAL
‚Üí USER IMPACT: BLOCKS "Print-Ready" status - required for compliance

**MEDIUM** - Requires professional judgment OR insufficient information to determine:
- Potentially misleading wording (requires interpretation)
- Ambiguous structure/function claims (gray area)
- **ALLERGEN UNCERTAINTY**: "natural flavors" may contain allergens - cannot determine from label
- **INGREDIENT COMPOSITION UNKNOWN**: "artificial cream flavor" may contain milk - requires verification
- Allergen cross-contact warnings ("may contain" - not legally required, industry practice)
- Font size/legibility concerns (cannot measure accurately from image)
- Exemption eligibility (depends on factors not visible: company size, distribution)
- Net weight placement subjective ("prominent" is not precisely defined)
- Old dietary ingredient uncertainty (not in database but may be pre-1994)
‚Üí Professional judgment or supplier verification needed
‚Üí USER IMPACT: Does NOT block "Print-Ready" - user can verify and proceed

**LOW** - Best practices and optional improvements:
- Voluntary nutrient declarations (not required)
- QR codes for additional information
- Optional claims (non-GMO, organic) when not currently claiming
- Enhanced readability suggestions
- Metric conversions (when not required)
- Additional language translations
- Sustainability/sourcing information
‚Üí Optional enhancements for consumer appeal
‚Üí USER IMPACT: Does NOT block "Print-Ready" - nice to have

**PRIORITY ASSIGNMENT DECISION TREE**:

When assigning recommendation priorities, follow this logic:

STEP 1: Can I see a clear violation on this label?
‚Üí YES: Go to STEP 2
‚Üí NO: Go to STEP 3

STEP 2: Clear violation is visible
Ask: What is the enforcement risk?
‚Üí High risk (missing allergen declaration, prohibited claims, wrong panel type): CRITICAL
‚Üí Lower risk (formatting, ingredient order, minor omissions): HIGH

STEP 3: Cannot determine or uncertain
Ask: Why can't I determine?
‚Üí Insufficient information (natural flavors allergen status, can't measure font, not in database): MEDIUM
‚Üí Ambiguous regulation (gray area where experts might disagree): MEDIUM
‚Üí It's optional or best practice: LOW

**CRITICAL RULE FOR "potentially_non_compliant" SECTIONS**:

When a section status is "potentially_non_compliant" due to INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION (not due to a visible violation), the recommendation priority MUST be MEDIUM, never CRITICAL or HIGH.

Examples:
- Section: Allergen Labeling, Status: potentially_non_compliant
  - "natural flavors may contain allergens" ‚Üí Priority: MEDIUM (verify with supplier)
  - "whey contains milk, no declaration" ‚Üí Priority: CRITICAL (visible violation)

- Section: NDI Compliance, Status: potentially_non_compliant
  - "cordyceps not in database" ‚Üí Priority: MEDIUM (verify market history)

- Section: Font Size, Status: potentially_non_compliant
  - "appears small, cannot measure" ‚Üí Priority: MEDIUM (measure physical label)

NEVER assign CRITICAL or HIGH priority when the issue is uncertainty or lack of information.
ONLY assign CRITICAL or HIGH when you can SEE a clear regulatory violation on the label.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Use conditional language for potential violations (e.g., "IF artificial cream flavor contains milk protein, THEN...")
2. Always consider exemptions before marking nutrition labeling as non-compliant
3. Provide specific regulation citations (CFR sections, act names) for every finding
4. Distinguish between "non-compliant" (definite violation) and "potentially non-compliant" (conditional on information not visible)
5. For coffee, spices, and similar products: they are typically EXEMPT from Nutrition Facts panels
6. Base compliance status on visible information; use "potentially non-compliant" when ingredient composition is unknown
7. In the compliance_table, provide a clear summary similar to the NotebookLM format
8. **PANEL TYPE MISMATCH = CRITICAL VIOLATION**: If product is classified as DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT but has "Nutrition Facts" panel (or vice versa), this is a CRITICAL priority recommendation. Generate recommendation: "Replace [wrong panel type] with [correct panel type] per [regulation citation]"`;
