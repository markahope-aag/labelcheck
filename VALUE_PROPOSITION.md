# LabelCheck Value Proposition

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** Finalized

---

## Core Value Proposition

**"LabelCheck helps small food brands launch products confidently by checking full FDA compliance (allergens, GRAS, claims—not just nutrition facts) in minutes for $49-399/month, unlike $240+ consultant reviews or nutrition-only generators."**

---

## Key Components

### **Target Customer (WHO)**
- Small-medium food/beverage/supplement brands
- 3-50 SKUs in portfolio
- No in-house regulatory team
- Can't afford enterprise software ($500+/month)
- Can't afford per-review consultants ($240+ each)

**Example:** Sarah runs a cold brew coffee company with 8 SKUs. She has compliance anxiety but can't justify hiring a full-time regulatory person or paying $240 per label review.

---

### **Desired Outcome (WHAT)**
**Launch products confidently**

Confidence means:
- ✅ No FDA warning letters
- ✅ No product recalls
- ✅ No allergen violations (FALCPA/FASTER)
- ✅ No prohibited health claims
- ✅ Sleep at night knowing labels are compliant

Not just "compliant" but **confidently compliant** - peace of mind backed by data.

---

### **How We Deliver (METHOD)**
**Full FDA compliance checking in minutes**

Specifically includes (what others miss):
- ✅ **Allergens** (FALCPA/FASTER) - 9 major allergens + 400+ derivatives
- ✅ **GRAS ingredients** (1,465 FDA-approved) - food/beverage only
- ✅ **NDI compliance** (dietary supplements) - 1,253 notifications + 2,193 grandfathered
- ✅ **Health/structure claims** - prohibited vs. allowed
- ✅ **Nutrition/Supplement Facts** - formatting and requirements
- ✅ **General labeling** - net weight, manufacturer info, ingredient order

**Not just nutrition facts** - this is the key differentiator.

**Speed:** Minutes (vs. weeks with consultants)
**Price:** $49-399/month (vs. $240+ per review)

---

### **Alternatives & Why They Fall Short**

#### **Alternative 1: Nutrition Facts Generators**
**Examples:** ReciPal, Genesis R&D, MenuCalc

**What they do:** Calculate nutrition facts panels from ingredient inputs
**What they miss:** 80% of FDA requirements
- ❌ No allergen compliance checking
- ❌ No GRAS verification
- ❌ No claims analysis
- ❌ No ingredient order validation
- ❌ No comprehensive compliance

**Their positioning:** "Generate nutrition labels"
**Their customer:** Someone who just needs nutrition facts

**Why LabelCheck wins:** Customers realize nutrition facts are only 20% of compliance. When Sarah gets a warning letter for missing allergen declaration, ReciPal didn't help her.

---

#### **Alternative 2: Regulatory Consultants**
**Examples:** Local food law attorneys, regulatory consultants, CROs

**What they do:** Manual label review by humans (1-2 weeks per label)
**What they cost:** $240-500 per label review, $150-300/hour

**Why they're expensive:**
- 2-4 hours per label review
- Expertise premium (regulatory knowledge)
- Iterative revisions cost extra
- Slow turnaround (1-2 weeks)

**Their positioning:** "Expert regulatory guidance"
**Their customer:** Large brands with budgets, complex novel ingredients

**Why LabelCheck wins:** Sarah can't afford $240 × 8 SKUs = $1,920 upfront. And every revision costs another $240. LabelCheck is $149/month for 50 analyses (enough for 8 products × 3-5 revisions each).

---

#### **Alternative 3: Enterprise Software**
**Examples:** Label Insight, Trace One, Specright, Esha Genesis R&D Pro

**What they do:** Comprehensive PLM (product lifecycle management) with compliance modules
**What they cost:** $500-2,000/month + implementation fees + training

**Why they're overkill:**
- Built for 100+ SKU enterprises
- Complex setup (weeks/months)
- Feature bloat (PLM, suppliers, production)
- Requires dedicated admin

**Their positioning:** "End-to-end product lifecycle management"
**Their customer:** Fortune 500 food companies, national retailers

**Why LabelCheck wins:** Sarah doesn't need supply chain management or production tracking. She needs to know if her label will pass FDA inspection. $49-149/month vs. $500+/month, and she can start analyzing in 2 minutes vs. weeks of implementation.

**We created a new category:**
- Affordable (like generators)
- Comprehensive (like consultants/enterprise)
- Fast (like software)
- SMB-focused (like generators)

**Blue Ocean:** Nobody offers comprehensive compliance checking at SMB prices. That's the wedge.

## Application Across Channels

### **Homepage Headline**
```
Launch FDA-Compliant Products Confidently

Check allergens, GRAS, and claims—not just nutrition facts—in minutes.
From $49/month. No $240+ consultant fees.

[Start Free Trial - 10 Analyses] [View Pricing]
```

### **Investor Pitch (30-second)**
```
"Small food brands can't afford $500/month enterprise software or
$240 per consultant review, but nutrition-facts-only generators
miss 80% of FDA requirements.

We check everything—allergens, GRAS, claims, formatting—for
$49-399/month with instant AI analysis.

We're the Grammarly for food labels: comprehensive, fast, and
affordable. Target tier: $149/month Professional (50 analyses)."
```

### **Sales Script (Discovery)**
```
"How are you checking your labels for allergen compliance today?"

→ "Just using ReciPal/Genesis?"
   "Those are great for nutrition facts, but they don't catch
    allergen violations or prohibited claims. We check all of
    that—everything a consultant would—starting at $49/month
    instead of $240 per review."

→ "We work with a consultant?"
   "How much does that cost per label? ... $240? And how many
    revisions do you typically do? ... 2-3? So $720 per product?
    Our Professional plan is $149/month for 50 analyses—enough
    for 8-10 products with multiple revisions. You'd break even
    after just 1-2 products."

→ "We don't check, just copy competitors?"
   "That's risky—if their label has violations, yours will too.
    Plus FDA requires allergen declarations specific to YOUR
    formula. Want to see what issues your current labels have?
    First 10 analyses free."
```

### **Feature Prioritization Test**
For any new feature, ask:

**"Does this feature help small brands achieve full FDA compliance beyond just nutrition facts, faster than consultants, cheaper than enterprise software?"**

If NO → Deprioritize (nice-to-have, not core value)
If YES → Prioritize (directly supports value prop)

Examples:
- ✅ NDI database checking → YES (comprehensive compliance)
- ✅ Print-ready certification → YES (confidence outcome)
- ✅ Iterative analysis sessions → YES (faster than consultants)
- ❌ Recipe cost calculator → NO (not compliance-focused)
- ❌ Social media graphics generator → NO (not our category)

## Competitive Positioning Statements

### **vs. Nutrition Generators**
"Unlike ReciPal or Genesis R&D which only generate nutrition facts, LabelCheck checks your entire label for FDA compliance—allergens, GRAS, claims, and formatting. Nutrition facts are just 20% of what FDA inspects."

### **vs. Consultants**
"Unlike consultants that charge $240+ per label review and take 1-2 weeks, LabelCheck delivers comprehensive compliance analysis in minutes for a flat monthly fee. Unlimited revisions included."

### **vs. Enterprise Software**
"Unlike enterprise PLM systems that cost $500+/month and require weeks of setup, LabelCheck is purpose-built for small brands who need compliance checking—not supply chain management. Start analyzing in 2 minutes."

### **vs. DIY/Nothing**
"Reading FDA regulations yourself takes hours per label and it's easy to miss critical requirements like allergen declarations or GRAS violations. LabelCheck has every regulation built in and checks everything in 60 seconds."

## Customer Success Definition

**Sarah succeeds when:**
1. She uploads her label
2. Gets comprehensive compliance analysis in < 2 minutes
3. Sees specific issues with regulations cited
4. Fixes issues and re-uploads
5. Achieves "Print-Ready" certification ✅
6. Launches product without FDA warnings
7. **Feels confident she didn't miss anything**

Success = Confidence + Speed + Affordability

Not just "compliant" but **confidently compliant** with proof.

---

## Why This Matters

This value proposition is your:
- ✅ **Strategic filter** - what to build vs. ignore
- ✅ **Marketing foundation** - homepage, ads, content
- ✅ **Sales script** - how reps position the product
- ✅ **Investor story** - market gap and solution fit
- ✅ **Hiring criteria** - who understands this mission
- ✅ **Pricing anchor** - positioned between generators and consultants

**Everything flows from this clarity.**

If a feature, message, or decision doesn't support "comprehensive compliance for small brands at affordable prices faster than alternatives," it's a distraction.

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### **Product-Market Fit Signals**
- Trial-to-paid conversion rate (target: 40%+)
- Analyses per user before conversion (target: 7-10)
- "Print-Ready" achievement rate (target: 60%+)
- Repeat usage (monthly active analyses)

### **Positioning Validation**
- Inbound: "I found you searching for [allergen compliance] / [GRAS checking]" (not just "nutrition label")
- Sales calls: "ReciPal doesn't check allergens" / "Consultant too expensive"
- Reviews: "Finally comprehensive checking" / "Everything in one place"
- Churn reasons: Price too high = wrong customer / Missing feature = product gap

---

## Evolution Path

As we grow, this positioning can evolve:

**Today (MVP):**
"Comprehensive FDA compliance for small brands"

**Tomorrow (Scale):**
"The compliance platform for emerging brands"
- Add claim substantiation
- Add formula compliance
- Add supplier ingredient verification

**Future (Enterprise):**
"The regulatory operating system for food companies"
- Full PLM integration
- Multi-market compliance (FDA + EU + Canada)
- API for e-commerce platforms

But we **start** with the clear wedge: comprehensive compliance at SMB prices.

Don't dilute the message by trying to be everything to everyone.
