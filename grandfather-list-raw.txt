CRN LIST OF DIETARY INGREDIENTS
“GRANDFATHERED” UNDER DSHEA
Prepared by the
Council for Responsible Nutrition:
based on a list compiled by the
National Nutritional Foods Association,
with additions submitted
by CRN members
September 1998
This list is compiled solely for reference purposes
and does not constitute verification
that any specific dietary ingredient was or was not
marketed as a dietary supplement before October 15, 1994

CRN LIST OF DIETARY INGREDIENTS
“GRANDFATHERED” UNDER DSHEA
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) established conditions
under which a “new dietary ingredient” could be used in a dietary supplement.
According to DSHEA, a “new dietary ingredient” means “a dietary ingredient that was
not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 and does not include any
dietary ingredient which was marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994.”
By this provision, dietary ingredients already in use as of October 15, 1994, were
“grandfathered.”
There is no definitive list of “grandfathered” dietary ingredients.  The National
Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA) produced a list in 1995, based on label
information available under its TruLabel program.  That list contained ingredients such as
vitamins, minerals, and amino acids, plus some botanicals.  Also in 1995, the American
Herbal Products Association (AHPA) produced a list of botanical ingredients.  The
Council for Responsible Nutrition circulated the NNFA list to CRN members for review,
and member companies recommended some additional ingredients which they asserted
were in use prior to October 15, 1994.  The attached list resulted from that review, and
CRN additions are specifically noted.  CRN members did not review or add to the AHPA
botanical list.
The CRN list, attached, should be viewed solely as a reference document.  The best
policy is for any company to maintain its own records confirming longterm use of an
ingredient.  CRN has not independently verified that ingredients on this list were in fact
in use prior to October 15, 1994.  This list is based solely on the NNFA list and the
additions recommended by CRN members.  For a more complete list of botanicals, see
the AHPA list.
It is CRN’s understanding that excipients were not grandfathered by DSHEA.  However,
it is not always clear from the name of a substance whether it is used an excipient or a
dietary ingredient.  Thus, the attached list may contain some excipients which appeared
in the NNFA list or which were recommended for addition by CRN members.
