## Strategic Positioning

### **Why These Price Points?**

#### **Anchored Between Alternatives:**

```
Nutrition Generators          LabelCheck              Consultants
($20-50/month)          ($49-399/month)          ($240+ per review)
     ↓                        ↓                          ↓
 Incomplete              Comprehensive              Comprehensive
 Self-service            Self-service                Full-service
 Fast                    Fast                        Slow
```

**LabelCheck pricing strategy:**
- **Higher than generators** ($20-50) because we offer 80% more value (full compliance vs. nutrition only)
- **Lower than consultants** ($240+ per review) because we're self-service software
- **Much lower than enterprise** ($500+ /month) because we're SMB-focused

---

### **Starter Tier: $49/month (10 analyses)**

**Customer Profile:**
- Very small brands (3-5 SKUs total)
- Limited budget, testing market fit
- Seasonal/limited launches
- Single product line

**Value Proposition:**
- Same as trial but monthly recurring
- Analysis history (3 months)
- Export PDF reports
- Email support

**Why $49 (not $29)?**

✅ **Value-based pricing:**
- Saves $240+ per consultant review
- Comprehensive checking (not just nutrition facts)
- One critical violation avoided = ROI recovered

✅ **Category positioning:**
- Clearly premium vs. nutrition generators ($20-50)
- Signals "professional tool" not "calculator"
- Avoids race-to-the-bottom pricing

✅ **Customer filtering:**
- $49 is affordable for serious buyers
- High enough to deter tire-kickers
- Low enough for small brand budgets

**Usage Pattern:**
- 10 analyses = 2-3 products + 2-3 revisions each
- Monthly recurring for ongoing compliance management
- Perfect for brands with slow product launch cycles

---

### **Professional Tier: $149/month (50 analyses) ⭐ TARGET**

**Customer Profile:**
- Growing brands (10-20 SKUs)
- Regular product launches
- Multiple product lines
- Active iteration (2-3 revisions per product)

**Value Proposition:**
- Enough analyses for full portfolio management
- 50 analyses = 8-10 products × 3-5 revisions
- Annual history (track improvements over time)
- Priority support
- Team collaboration (coming soon)

**Why $149?**

✅ **Sweet spot for ROI:**
```
Consultant Alternative:
  $240 per review × 3 products = $720
  LabelCheck: $149 = Save $571 (79% savings)

Annual Comparison:
  Consultants: $720 × 4 product launches/year = $2,880
  LabelCheck: $149 × 12 months = $1,788
  Annual savings: $1,092 (38% savings)
```

✅ **Volume discount psychology:**
- $149/50 analyses = $2.98 per analysis
- vs. $49/10 analyses = $4.90 per analysis
- 40% cheaper per unit → strong upgrade incentive

✅ **Target customer willingness to pay:**
- Growing brands have revenue ($100K-$500K/year)
- Compliance anxiety is high (more SKUs = more risk)
- $149/month is 0.3-1.8% of monthly revenue (affordable)
- One recall costs $10K-50K+ (massive ROI)

**This is our hero tier:**
- 60% of customers should be on Professional
- Highest total revenue contribution
- Best retention (most usage → most value)

---

### **Business Tier: $399/month (200 analyses)**

**Customer Profile:**
- Large SMBs (50+ SKUs)
- Frequent launches (10+ per year)

**Value Proposition:**

**Why $399?**

✅ **High-volume customers:**
- $399/200 analyses = $2.00 per analysis (best unit economics)
- vs. Professional: $2.98 per analysis (33% cheaper)
- Rewards heavy usage

✅ **Enterprise-lite positioning:**
- Just below enterprise software pricing ($500+)
- Self-service (no implementation fees)
- Still affordable for SMBs ($5K/year vs. $10-20K for enterprise)

✅ **Team features:**
- Team collaboration (5-10 users)
- API access for e-commerce integration
- Custom regulatory uploads
- Dedicated support

**Customer retention:**
- Highest-value customers

## Annual Pricing: 2 Months Free

| Tier | Monthly × 12 | Annual Price | Savings | Discount % |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|------------|
| Starter | $588 | $490 | $98 | 17% |
| Professional | $1,788 | $1,490 | $298 | 17% |
| Business | $4,788 | $3,990 | $798 | 17% |

**Why 2 months free (vs. 1 month or 3 months)?**

✅ **Cash flow optimization:**
- Immediate cash: $490, $1,490, or $3,990 upfront
- Better than monthly recurring for runway
- Reduces churn (12-month commitment)

✅ **Competitive standard:**
- Most B2B SaaS offers 15-20% annual discount
- 2 months free = 17% discount (industry standard)
- Not too aggressive (devalues product)

✅ **Customer psychology:**
- "2 months free" more tangible than "17% off"
- Creates urgency ("save $298/year")
- Annual feels like commitment to success

**Expected mix:**
- 30% annual (Professional and Business)
- 70% monthly (Starter and trial converts)

| Genesis R&D | $49-99/mo | Nutrition facts + some claims |
| MenuCalc | $30/mo | Nutrition facts only |

---

## Price Increase Rationale

### **Old Pricing (Deprecated):**
- Basic: $29/mo, 10 analyses
- Pro: $79/mo, 50 analyses
- Enterprise: $199/mo, unlimited

### **New Pricing:**
- Starter: $49/mo, 10 analyses (+$20, +69%)
- Professional: $149/mo, 50 analyses (+$70, +89%)
- Business: $399/mo, 200 analyses (+$200, +100%)

**Why the increase?**

✅ **Value-based pricing (not cost-plus):**
- Old pricing anchored to nutrition generators ($20-50)
- New pricing anchored to value delivered (avoids $240+ consultant fees)
- One violation avoided = $10K+ recall cost → massive ROI

✅ **Category repositioning:**
- We're not "a better nutrition calculator"
- We're "affordable comprehensive compliance checking"
- Premium pricing signals premium value

✅ **Target customer willingness to pay:**
- Old price attracted tire-kickers (hobbyists, curious browsers)
- New price filters for serious buyers (brands with revenue and budgets)
- $149/month is affordable for any brand doing $100K+/year

✅ **Competitive positioning:**
- Still 60-80% cheaper than consultants
- Still 55-80% cheaper than enterprise software
- Premium enough to avoid generator comparison

✅ **Unit economics:**
- Higher prices = fewer customers needed to reach revenue goals
- Better LTV:CAC ratio (higher ARPU, same CAC)
- Can invest more in product quality and support

---

## Usage-Based vs. Flat-Rate

**Why analyses-based pricing (not unlimited)?**

✅ **Predictable costs:**
- Users know exactly what they're getting
- No "unlimited" abuse risk
- Scales with customer value (more SKUs = more analyses = higher tier)

✅ **Natural upgrade path:**
- Start with 10 analyses (Starter)
- Grow to 50 analyses (Professional)
- Scale to 200 analyses (Business)
- Clear migration trigger (usage exceeds limit)

✅ **Fair value exchange:**
- Heavy users pay more (200 analyses)
- Light users pay less (10 analyses)
- Aligns pricing with value delivered

❌ **Why not unlimited?**
- Race to the bottom (everyone picks unlimited tier)
- No natural upgrade incentive
- Heavy users subsidized by light users (unfair)
- Hard to predict infrastructure costs

---

## Free Trial Strategy

**10 free analyses (no time limit)**

**Why 10?**
- Enough for full product line evaluation (3-5 products + revisions)
- Experience complete value (find issues → fix → print-ready)
- Convert after success (not frustration)

**Why usage-based (not time-based)?**
- Matches buying cycle (weeks/months, not days)
- No pressure from artificial urgency
- Natural conversion point (after 10th analysis)

**See:** `FREE_TRIAL_STRATEGY.md` for full rationale

## Revenue Modeling

### **Target Customer Mix (Year 1):**
- 40% Starter ($49) = 200 customers × $49 = $9,800/mo
- 50% Professional ($149) = 250 customers × $149 = $37,250/mo
- 10% Business ($399) = 50 customers × $399 = $19,950/mo

**Total: 500 customers = $67,000 MRR = $804,000 ARR**

### **With Annual Uplift (30% annual):**
- 70% monthly: $46,900/mo
- 30% annual: $20,100/mo equivalent (paid upfront)

**Blended MRR: ~$67,000**

### **Customer Lifetime Value (Professional):**
```
ARPU: $149/month
Retention: 85% (15% monthly churn)
Average lifetime: 6.7 months
LTV = $149 × 6.7 = $998

With annual pricing (lower churn):
Retention: 92% (8% monthly churn)
Average lifetime: 12.5 months
LTV = $149 × 12.5 = $1,863
```

## Pricing Psychology

### **Anchoring:**
- Lead with Professional tier ($149) as "Most Popular"
- Makes Starter feel affordable by comparison
- Makes Business feel premium (not overpriced)

### **Good-Better-Best:**
- Starter = Good (basic needs)
- Professional = Better (recommended, 60% choose this)
- Business = Best (power users)

**Avoid 4+ tiers** (paradox of choice)

### **Price Framing:**

❌ **Bad:** "$149 per month"
✅ **Good:** "$149/month for 50 analyses"
✅ **Better:** "$149/month (less than 1 consultant review)"
✅ **Best:** "$149/month saves you $571 vs. consultants"

**Always tie price to value, not just cost.**
