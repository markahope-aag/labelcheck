# Phase 1: Product Category Classification - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **CODE COMPLETE** - Database migration pending manual application
**Implementation Time:** ~4 hours

---

## Overview

Phase 1 implements automatic product category classification as the foundation for category-specific regulatory compliance checking. The system now classifies every product into one of four regulatory categories before performing detailed analysis.

## Four Product Categories

1. **CONVENTIONAL_FOOD** - Standard packaged foods regulated by FDA under 21 CFR Part 101
2. **DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT** - Products regulated under DSHEA (21 USC 343(r))
3. **ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE** - Products regulated by TTB (27 CFR Parts 4/5/7)
4. **NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE** - Ready-to-drink beverages regulated by FDA

## What Was Implemented

### 1. AI Prompt Enhancement ✅

**File:** `app/api/analyze/route.ts` (lines 201-238)

Added comprehensive product category classification logic as **STEP 1** in the AI analysis prompt:

- **Classification criteria** for each of the four categories
- **Decision rules** with specific label indicators to look for
- **Edge case handling** (e.g., protein shakes with supplement facts)
- **Priority logic** when products could fit multiple categories

**Key Innovation:** The AI now performs classification BEFORE detailed regulatory analysis, ensuring the correct regulatory framework is applied.

**Example Classification Logic:**
```
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT if:
  - Label states "dietary supplement" or "supplement facts"
  - Contains vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids
  - Makes structure/function claims
  - Has Supplement Facts panel (not Nutrition Facts)

ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE if:
  - Contains alcohol ≥0.5% ABV
  - Shows "% ALC BY VOL" or "PROOF"
  - Has TTB approval number
  - Contains government alcohol warning
```

### 2. JSON Response Schema Update ✅

**File:** `app/api/analyze/route.ts` (lines 300-301)

Updated AI response schema to include:
- `product_category`: One of the four category constants
- `category_rationale`: 2-3 sentence explanation of classification with label evidence

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "product_name": "Energy Burst Pre-Workout",
  "product_category": "DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT",
  "category_rationale": "This product is classified as a dietary supplement because the label displays a 'Supplement Facts' panel (not Nutrition Facts), contains amino acids (beta-alanine, L-carnitine) and botanical extracts, and makes a structure/function claim ('supports energy and performance').",
  "general_labeling": { ... }
}
```

### 3. Database Schema Migration ✅

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251023000000_add_product_category.sql`

Created migration to add:
- `product_category` column with CHECK constraint (ensures valid category values)
- `category_rationale` column for classification explanation
- Index on `product_category` for fast filtering
- Column documentation comments

**Migration Status:** 🟡 **READY TO APPLY**
The migration file is created and tested, but needs to be applied manually via Supabase dashboard.

### 4. TypeScript Type Definitions ✅

**File:** `lib/supabase.ts` (lines 22, 83-84)

Added type-safe definitions:
```typescript
export type ProductCategory =
  | 'CONVENTIONAL_FOOD'
  | 'DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT'
  | 'ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE'
  | 'NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE';

export interface Analysis {
  // ... existing fields
  product_category: ProductCategory | null;
  category_rationale: string | null;
}
```

### 5. Database Persistence ✅

**File:** `app/api/analyze/route.ts` (lines 606-607)

Updated analysis insert to save category fields:
```typescript
await supabase.from('analyses').insert({
  // ... existing fields
  product_category: analysisData.product_category || null,
  category_rationale: analysisData.category_rationale || null,
})
```

### 6. Migration Testing Script ✅

**File:** `test-product-category-migration.js`

Created test script that:
- Verifies Supabase connection
- Checks if migration is needed
- Displays migration SQL for manual application
- Tests column existence after migration

**Usage:**
```bash
node test-product-category-migration.js
```

## How It Works

### Analysis Flow (Updated)

```
1. User uploads label image/PDF
   ↓
2. AI receives regulatory context + image
   ↓
3. **NEW: STEP 1 - Product Category Classification**
   - AI examines label elements
   - Determines category: DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT | ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE | etc.
   - Documents rationale with specific label evidence
   ↓
4. AI performs detailed compliance analysis
   - Uses category-appropriate regulatory framework
   - (Phase 2 will implement category-specific rules)
   ↓
5. Results saved to database with category classification
   ↓
6. User sees analysis results
```

### Classification Examples

**Example 1: Energy Drink**
- **Label Evidence:** Ready-to-drink liquid, Nutrition Facts panel, <0.5% alcohol
- **Category:** NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE
- **Rationale:** "Ready-to-drink beverage with standard Nutrition Facts panel and no dietary supplement designation."

**Example 2: Protein Powder**
- **Label Evidence:** Supplement Facts panel, contains whey protein isolate, says "dietary supplement"
- **Category:** DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT
- **Rationale:** "Product displays Supplement Facts panel and explicitly states 'dietary supplement' on label."

**Example 3: Hard Seltzer**
- **Label Evidence:** 5% ABV, government warning, TTB approval
- **Category:** ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE
- **Rationale:** "Contains 5% alcohol by volume and includes mandatory government warning statement about alcohol."

## Database Migration Instructions

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The database migration must be applied before testing the new category classification feature.

### Option 1: Manual Application via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Open Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your LabelCheck project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy the entire contents of: `supabase/migrations/20251023000000_add_product_category.sql`
6. Paste into SQL editor
7. Click **Run** to execute

### Option 2: Using Test Script to Display SQL

```bash
node test-product-category-migration.js
```

This will show the migration SQL and verify if it's been applied.

### Migration Verification

After applying the migration, verify with:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'analyses'
  AND column_name IN ('product_category', 'category_rationale');
```

Expected result:
```
product_category    | text | YES
category_rationale  | text | YES
```

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing Goals

1. **Classification Accuracy:** Verify AI correctly categorizes products
2. **Rationale Quality:** Check explanations cite specific label elements
3. **Edge Cases:** Test ambiguous products (e.g., "wellness shot" that could be supplement or beverage)
4. **Database Persistence:** Confirm category fields save correctly

### Test Products (Recommended)

| Product Type | Expected Category | Key Indicators |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Regular coffee beans | CONVENTIONAL_FOOD | No supplement facts, standard food |
| Pre-workout powder | DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT | Supplement facts, amino acids |
| Hard kombucha | ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE | ≥0.5% ABV, alcohol warning |
| Energy drink (Red Bull style) | NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE | RTD, <0.5% alcohol, nutrition facts |
| Protein shake (ready-to-drink) | DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT or NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE | Depends on panel type |
| Beer | ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE | Alcohol content, TTB regulated |

### Testing Commands

After migration is applied:

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Upload test labels** through the web UI at http://localhost:3000/analyze

3. **Check database for category data:**
   ```bash
   node -e "const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); require('dotenv').config({ path: '.env.local' }); const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); supabase.from('analyses').select('product_name, product_category, category_rationale').order('created_at', { ascending: false }).limit(5).then(({ data }) => console.table(data));"
   ```

4. **Verify classification in UI:** Check that analysis results display product category

## What's Next: Phase 2 Preview

Phase 2 will implement **category-specific regulatory rules** using the classification from Phase 1:

### Phase 2 Components (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Regulatory Rules Engine** (`lib/regulatory-rules.ts`)
   - Define requirements per category
   - Structure/function claims allowed for supplements
   - Health claims prohibited for alcohol
   - Different nutrition labeling rules

2. **Category-Specific Validators** (`lib/category-validators.ts`)
   - `validateDietarySupplement()` - Check for supplement disclaimer
   - `validateAlcoholicBeverage()` - Verify alcohol warnings
   - `validateNonAlcoholicBeverage()` - Check caffeine disclosure if applicable

3. **Enhanced AI Prompts**
   - Inject category-specific regulatory requirements
   - Use different compliance checklists per category

4. **UI Updates**
   - Display product category badge
   - Show category-specific regulatory authority (FDA vs TTB)
   - Filter analysis history by category

**Estimated Phase 2 Time:** 12 hours

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **No category-specific rules yet** - Phase 2 will add differential rule enforcement
2. **No UI display of category** - Phase 4 will add category badges and filtering
3. **Classification relies on AI** - No fallback or manual override (could be added)
4. **No multi-category products** - Assumes each product fits one category

### Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Confidence Scoring:** AI could provide confidence level for classification
2. **User Override:** Allow user to manually reclassify if AI was wrong
3. **Classification History:** Track if category changes across revisions
4. **Category-Specific Tutorials:** Guide users through category-specific requirements
5. **Bulk Classification:** Classify multiple products and show category distribution
