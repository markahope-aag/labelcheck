## REMEMBER: Category Confidence

Since you've been told this is a DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT, always set:
- `"category_confidence": "high"`
- `"category_ambiguity": { "is_ambiguous": false, ... }`

Only set `is_ambiguous: true` if you find STRONG evidence the classification was wrong (e.g., has Nutrition Facts panel, clearly marketed as food/beverage).
