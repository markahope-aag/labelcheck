## STEP 3: OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Determine primary_compliance_status:**
- **Compliant**: Meets all non-alcoholic beverage requirements, no violations found
- **Potentially-Non-Compliant**: Likely violations present but depends on information not fully visible or verifiable
- **Non-Compliant**: Clear violations of beverage regulations (wrong panel type, missing required declarations, false claims, rounding violations)

**Provide 2-3 sentence summary** highlighting:
- Whether Nutrition Facts panel is correct and complete
- Major compliance issues found (if any)
- Critical areas needing attention

---

## STEP 4: RECOMMENDATIONS

**Prioritize recommendations:**
- **CRITICAL**: Must fix immediately (wrong panel type, missing juice percentage, allergen violations, false claims)
- **HIGH**: Important compliance issues (rounding errors, missing caffeine disclosure, incomplete ingredient list)
- **MEDIUM**: Minor improvements (formatting, clarity, best practices)
- **LOW**: Suggestions for optimization (additional certifications, improved labeling)

**For each recommendation:**
- Specific, actionable instruction
- Relevant regulation citation (21 CFR section)
- Priority level
- Example correction if applicable

**Example recommendations:**
- CRITICAL: "Change panel header from 'Supplement Facts' to 'Nutrition Facts' per 21 CFR 101.9(a)"
- HIGH: "Add percent juice declaration on information panel as product name contains 'juice' per 21 CFR 101.30"
- MEDIUM: "Verify Total Sugars rounding - showing 8g but calculation suggests 7.6g which should round to 8g (compliant) per 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)"
- LOW: "Consider adding caffeine amount in mg per serving for transparency (currently only states 'Contains Caffeine')"

## REMEMBER: Category Confidence

Since you've been told this is a NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE, always set:
- `"category_confidence": "high"`
- `"category_ambiguity": { "is_ambiguous": false, ... }`

Only set `is_ambiguous: true` if you find STRONG evidence the classification was wrong (e.g., has Supplement Facts panel, clearly marketed as dietary supplement, or appears to be an alcoholic beverage with â‰¥0.5% ABV).
