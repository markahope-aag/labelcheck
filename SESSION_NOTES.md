## Session 4 Summary (2025-10-23)

### ‚úÖ Completed in This Session

**Major Feature: Product Category Classification System (Phase 1)**

This session implemented the foundation for category-specific regulatory compliance by adding automatic product classification into four regulatory categories: Conventional Food, Dietary Supplements, Alcoholic Beverages, and Non-Alcoholic Beverages.

#### 1. Regulatory Analysis & Planning
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive regulatory category analysis (`REGULATORY_CATEGORY_ANALYSIS.md`)
  - Documented FDA vs TTB jurisdictions
  - Detailed comparison of nutrition labeling requirements
  - Health claims permissibility by category
  - GRAS applicability differences
  - Identified critical gaps in current generic approach

- ‚úÖ Created detailed implementation plan (`REGULATORY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`)
  - 5-phase technical roadmap (~44 hours total)
  - Code examples and database schema
  - Timeline and success criteria

#### 2. AI Prompt Enhancement
- ‚úÖ Updated analysis prompt with STEP 1: Product Category Classification
  - Added classification criteria for all four categories
  - Included decision rules with specific label indicators
  - Edge case handling (e.g., protein shakes)
  - File: `app/api/analyze/route.ts` (lines 201-238)

#### 3. JSON Schema Update
- ‚úÖ Added product_category and category_rationale fields to AI response
  - `product_category`: One of four enum values
  - `category_rationale`: Explanation with label evidence
  - File: `app/api/analyze/route.ts` (lines 300-301)

#### 4. Database Migration
- ‚úÖ Created migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251023000000_add_product_category.sql`
  - Adds `product_category` column with CHECK constraint
  - Adds `category_rationale` column for classification explanation
  - Creates index for fast filtering
  - Adds documentation comments
  - **Status:** Ready to apply via Supabase dashboard

- ‚úÖ Created test script: `test-product-category-migration.js`
  - Verifies migration status
  - Displays SQL for manual application

#### 5. TypeScript Type Safety
- ‚úÖ Added ProductCategory type enum
  - File: `lib/supabase.ts` (line 22)
  - Values: CONVENTIONAL_FOOD | DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT | ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE | NON_ALCOHOLIC_BEVERAGE

- ‚úÖ Updated Analysis interface
  - Added `product_category: ProductCategory | null`
  - Added `category_rationale: string | null`
  - File: `lib/supabase.ts` (lines 83-84)

#### 6. Database Persistence
- ‚úÖ Updated analysis insert to save category fields
  - File: `app/api/analyze/route.ts` (lines 606-607)
  - Saves AI classification to database

#### 7. Quality Assurance
- ‚úÖ TypeScript type checking: PASSED (no errors)
- ‚úÖ Installed dotenv dependency for migration scripts
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive Phase 1 summary document

   - Create `lib/regulatory-rules.ts` with rule definitions
   - Define requirements per category
   - Implement rule validation logic

4. **Fix AI Marketing Claims Consistency** (from Session 3)

## Session 3 Summary (2025-10-22)

### ‚úÖ Completed in This Session

1. **Phase 6: Revised Image Upload** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented complete revised label upload workflow
   - Added state management for revision mode (`isRevisedMode`, `previousResult`)
   - Created visual comparison component showing improvement metrics
   - Displays previous vs current issue counts with visual indicators
   - Shows green highlight for fully compliant results
   - File: `app/analyze/page.tsx`

2. **RLS Permission Fixes** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed chat endpoint to use `supabaseAdmin` for session reads/writes
   - Fixed text checker endpoint to use `supabaseAdmin` for session reads/writes
   - Resolves "violates row-level security policy" errors
   - Files: `app/api/analyze/chat/route.ts`, `app/api/analyze/text/route.ts`

3. **Chat Memory Enhancement** ‚úÖ
   - Increased context window from 3 to 5 chat exchanges
   - Better conversation continuity for users
   - File: `app/api/analyze/chat/route.ts` (line 110)

4. **Documentation Updates** ‚úÖ
   - Updated `docs/ANALYSIS_SESSIONS_FEATURE.md` with Phase 6 completion
   - Marked all three iteration methods as active
   - Updated testing scenarios and user flow documentation

### üéØ Current Status

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Image analysis with automatic session creation
- ‚úÖ Ask AI Questions (chat interface with 5-message context)
- ‚úÖ Check Text Alternative (text/PDF analyzer)
- ‚úÖ Upload Revised Label (with comparison metrics)
- ‚úÖ Visual comparison card showing improvement (X ‚Üí Y issues)
- ‚úÖ All RLS permission issues resolved

**Environment:**
- Server running on: http://localhost:3002
- Anthropic API key: Updated and working
- All three iteration buttons: ACTIVE

### üêõ Issues Identified (Not Yet Fixed)

**1. AI Analysis Consistency Issue** (Priority: High)
- **Problem:** Initial analysis marked "Superfood" as compliant in Statement of Identity
- **But:** Chat follow-up correctly identified it as problematic implied health claim
- **Impact:** Users may miss compliance issues that only surface in chat
- **Root Cause:** Initial analysis prompt doesn't emphasize scrutinizing marketing terms

**Example:**
```
Initial Analysis: ‚úÖ Statement of Identity: Compliant
Chat Question: "What about 'Superfood'?"
Chat Response: ‚ö†Ô∏è "Superfood" is an implied health claim requiring substantiation
```

**Need to Address:**
- Marketing terms like "superfood," "immunity," "detox," "natural healing"
- Should be flagged in initial analysis, not just chat
- Belongs in "Claims & Statements" section, not Statement of Identity

---

## üîÑ Next Steps (Priority Order)

## üìù Important Context for Next Session

### File Locations
- **Main analyze page:** `app/analyze/page.tsx`
- **Analysis API:** `app/api/analyze/route.ts` (prompt is here)
- **Chat API:** `app/api/analyze/chat/route.ts`
- **Text checker API:** `app/api/analyze/text/route.ts`
- **Session helpers:** `lib/session-helpers.ts`
- **Feature docs:** `docs/ANALYSIS_SESSIONS_FEATURE.md`

### Key Technical Notes
- Always use `supabaseAdmin` (with `useAdmin: true`) for session operations
- Chat memory: Last 5 exchanges (line 110 in chat route)
- Sessions created automatically on first image analysis
- Comparison logic in `calculateComparison()` function (analyze page)

### Testing Checklist
When testing prompt changes:
1. Upload label with "Superfood" or similar term
2. Check if initial analysis flags it
3. Ask chat about the term
4. Compare findings (should be consistent)
5. Test with other marketing terms (immunity, detox, natural)

---

## üéì AI Refinement Strategy (Discussed)

### Systematic Approach for Improving Analysis Quality

1. **Build Evaluation Dataset**
   - Create gold standard test cases
   - Document expected findings for each
   - Include compliant labels, problematic labels, edge cases

2. **Prompt Engineering Techniques**
   - Be specific (list red flag terms explicitly)
   - Use chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Include few-shot examples
   - Enforce structured output
   - Use temperature=0 for consistency

3. **Iterative Refinement Loop**
   - Run evaluation ‚Üí Identify gaps
   - Refine prompt ‚Üí Add guidance
   - Test again ‚Üí Measure improvement
   - Get expert review ‚Üí Validate
   - Deploy ‚Üí Monitor
   - Collect feedback ‚Üí Iterate

4. **Monitoring & Feedback**
   - Track when users ask chat about missed issues
   - Add "Was this helpful?" ratings
   - Log user disputes/corrections

## üìä Commits in This Session

```
631cf3d - Fix RLS permission issues and increase chat memory
dab5bd3 - Update documentation for Phase 6 completion
3d6f8ea - Implement Phase 6: Revised Image Upload with comparison feature
```

## üöÄ Ready to Continue?

**Quick Start Commands:**
```bash
cd C:\users\markh\projects\labelcheck
git status                    # Verify clean working tree
npm run dev                   # Start server (will use next available port)
```

**First Task:** Fix marketing claims consistency
- Start by reading: `app/api/analyze/route.ts` (lines 100-200, where prompt is defined)
- Look for: Section where AI instructions are built
- Goal: Add explicit guidance about marketing terms

---

**Questions to Address Next Session:**
1. Should we add a separate "Marketing Claims" section to analysis results?
2. What other common problematic terms should we flag? (immunity, detox, natural, etc.)
3. Should we create a regulatory term database/lookup?
4. How aggressive should we be with warnings? (flag everything vs only clear violations)
