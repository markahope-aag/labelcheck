- Essential mineral for human health
- Marketed in tablet form as electrolyte replenisher
- Primary dietary source of sodium and chloride

**Determination:** Definitively pre-1994. Correctly included in database.

**Sources:**
- NCBI Bookshelf - Recommended Dietary Allowances
- Multiple supplement product listings pre-dating 1994
- FDA nutritional guidance documents

### 3. Dipotassium Phosphate ✅ ALREADY IN DATABASE

**Database Status:** ✅ Found as "dipotassium phosphate" (CRN Grandfather List, September 1998)

**Regulatory History:**
- **1940s**: First used as food additive and preservative
- Used in mineral supplements and Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) therapy
- FDA GRAS status (date not specified, but decades before 1994)

### 4. Trehalose ❌ POST-1994 (Correctly NOT in database)

**Database Status:** ❌ Not found (correct)

**Regulatory History:**
- **May 2000**: FDA GRAS determination (first US approval)
- **October 2000**: FDA No Objection Letter to GRAS Notice GRN 000045
- **Prior approvals**: UK (1991), Korea/Taiwan (1998)
- **Not marketed in US until 2000**

**Determination:** Post-1994. Should NOT be added to database. Requires NDI notification.

**Sources:**
- FDA GRAS Notice Inventory (GRN 000045)
- ScienceDirect: "Trehalose: a review of properties, history of use and human tolerance"
- Nagase Foods corporate documentation

### 5. Stevia ⚠️ COMPLEX - ALREADY IN DATABASE

**Database Status:** ✅ Found as "stevia", "stevia rebaudiana" (CRN Grandfather List 1998, UNPA List 1999)

**Regulatory Complexity:**

**Evidence AGAINST Pre-1994 Status:**
- FDA banned stevia for all uses prior to DSHEA (1994)
- Remained banned until DSHEA passage
- **1995**: Sunrider Corporation filed NDI notification (suggests NEW ingredient)
- FDA issued "no objection" letter in response to NDI filing

**Evidence FOR Pre-1994 Status:**
- Included in CRN Grandfather List (September 1998)
- Included in UNPA Consolidated ODI List (1999)
- Multiple entries in our database from industry sources

**Resolution:**
After DSHEA (1994), FDA "revised its stance and permitted stevia to be used as a dietary supplement, although still not as a food additive." The NDI filing may have been precautionary or related to specific extraction methods.

**Industry Position:** CRN and UNPA both included stevia on grandfather lists, suggesting industry believed the PLANT (Stevia rebaudiana) was marketed before October 15, 1994, even if banned by FDA. The ban may not have been fully enforced, or products may have existed in interstate commerce.

**Determination:** Keep in database (sourced from legitimate industry lists). Note regulatory uncertainty.

**Sources:**
- FDA NDI Database
- CRN Grandfather List (September 1998)
- UNPA Consolidated ODI List (1999)
- FDA Guidance Documents

### 6. Luo Han Guo / Monk Fruit ❌ POST-1994 (Correctly NOT in database)

**Database Status:** ❌ Not found (correct)

**Regulatory History:**
- **1996**: First FDA NDI notifications accepted (earliest US market entry)
- **1999**: Additional NDI notification accepted
- **2010**: First FDA GRAS determination (GRN 301)
- **2011-2015**: Additional GRAS notifications (GRN 359, 522, 556)

**Determination:** Post-1994. Should NOT be added to database. Requires NDI notification.

**Sources:**
- FDA NDI Database (1996, 1999 notifications)
- FDA GRAS Notice Inventory (GRN 301, 359, 522, 556)

### 7. Natural Citrus Flavor ❌ EXCIPIENT (Correctly NOT in database)

**Database Status:** ❌ Not found (correct)

**Regulatory Analysis:**

**DSHEA Guidance on Flavorings:**
FDA guidance states that "other ingredients" include substances such as:
- Fillers
- Binders
- Excipients
- Preservatives
- Sweeteners
- **Flavorings**

These are NOT considered "dietary ingredients" under DSHEA.

**Key Quote from FDA Guidance:**
"It is not always clear from the name of a substance whether it is used as an excipient or a dietary ingredient."

**Determination:** Natural citrus flavor is an excipient/flavoring, NOT a dietary ingredient. Should NOT be added to database (not subject to NDI requirements).

**Sources:**
- FDA NDI Guidance Documents
- DSHEA legislative text
- Industry guidance from CRN

## Recommendations

### 1. No Database Updates Required ✅
All ingredients are correctly represented in the database:
- Pre-1994 ingredients are present
- Post-1994 ingredients are absent
- Excipients are absent

### 2. Update User-Facing Message ⚠️

**Current message states:**
> "The following ingredients are not in our pre-1994 dietary ingredients database..."

**Suggested enhancement:**
> "The following ingredients are not in our pre-1994 dietary ingredients database. This may mean:
> 1. **Post-1994 ingredient**: First marketed after Oct 15, 1994 (requires NDI notification)
> 2. **Excipient/flavoring**: Not classified as a 'dietary ingredient' under DSHEA
> 3. **Missing from database**: Pre-1994 ingredient not yet added to our reference lists
>
> Our database contains 2,194 old dietary ingredients from industry sources (CRN, UNPA, AHPA, NPA)."

### 3. Consider Adding Explanatory Notes

For ingredients like **Stevia** with regulatory complexity, consider adding a `notes` field in the database:

```sql
UPDATE old_dietary_ingredients
SET notes = 'Regulatory complexity: FDA banned stevia before DSHEA (1994), but industry lists include it as pre-1994. NDI notification filed in 1995 by Sunrider Corporation. Consult regulatory counsel for specific formulations.'
WHERE ingredient_name = 'stevia';
```

### 4. Future Database Enhancements

Consider adding these fields to improve clarity:
- `regulatory_status`: (grandfathered | ndi_required | excipient | gras_only)
- `fda_position`: Text field for FDA's official stance
- `industry_position`: Text field for industry association position
- `date_first_marketed`: Approximate date (if known)

## Regulatory References

### DSHEA Definition of Dietary Ingredient
21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1) defines "dietary ingredient" as:
- Vitamin
- Mineral
- Herb or other botanical
- Amino acid
- Dietary substance for use to supplement the diet by increasing total dietary intake
- Concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the above

**Excipients are NOT dietary ingredients.**

### NDI Notification Requirements
FD&C Act Section 413 requires manufacturers to notify FDA 75 days before marketing:
- New dietary ingredients (first marketed after October 15, 1994)
- New conditions of use for grandfathered ingredients

### Industry Reference Lists
- **CRN Grandfather List** (September 1998): ~1,000 ingredients
- **UNPA Consolidated ODI List** (1999): ~1,000 additional ingredients
- **NNFA/NPA Lists** (1995-1999): Various botanical and food-based ingredients
- **AHPA List**: Herbal and botanical ingredients

---

## Conclusion

The investigation confirms that our Old Dietary Ingredients database is **accurate and complete** for the ingredients in question. No updates are needed.

**Key Takeaway:** When users see ingredients flagged as "not in database," this is often CORRECT and EXPECTED for:
1. Post-1994 novel ingredients (Trehalose, Monk Fruit)
2. Excipients and flavorings (Natural Citrus Flavor)

The database should continue to rely on established industry reference lists (CRN, UNPA, AHPA, NPA) as the authoritative sources for pre-1994 dietary ingredients.
