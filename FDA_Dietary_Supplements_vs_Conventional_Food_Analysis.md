# Regulatory Differences Between Conventional Food Products and Dietary Supplements Under FDA Regulations

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the key regulatory distinctions between conventional food products and dietary supplements under FDA jurisdiction. The differences stem primarily from the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), which established dietary supplements as a distinct subcategory of foods with unique regulatory requirements.

---

## 1. INGREDIENT ALLOWANCES

### 1.1 Fundamental Regulatory Distinction

**Conventional Foods:**
- Any substance intentionally added to conventional food is a food additive subject to **premarket review and approval by FDA**
- Exemptions only if the substance is:
  - Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) under intended use conditions, OR
  - Commonly used in food before January 1, 1958

**Dietary Supplements:**
- Dietary ingredients are **excluded from the definition of food additives**
- The GRAS procedure does **not apply** to dietary ingredients
- Ingredients may be used in dietary supplements **without GRAS status or food additive approval**

**Regulatory Citation:** FD&C Act Section 201(ff); DSHEA 1994

### 1.2 GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) Requirements

**For Conventional Foods:**
- Food companies may determine ingredients are GRAS without FDA approval
- FDA established a voluntary GRAS notification program in 1997
- Companies may inform FDA of GRAS determinations but are not required to obtain authorization

**For Dietary Supplements:**
- GRAS requirements do not apply to dietary ingredients in supplements
- However, non-dietary ingredients added to supplements (binders, excipients, fillers) **must** be GRAS or approved food additives

**Key Distinction:** Dietary ingredients (vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, enzymes) may only be used in dietary supplements unless the ingredient also has GRAS status for use in conventional food.

### 1.3 New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) Requirements

Under DSHEA, ingredients not marketed in the U.S. prior to October 15, 1994, are labeled "new dietary ingredients" (NDI).

**Requirements:**
- NDI notification (NDIN) must be submitted to FDA at least **75 days before** product introduction
- Must include documentation demonstrating the ingredient will "reasonably be expected to be safe"
- Notification must include:
  - Description of the NDI and manufacturing process
  - Physical, chemical, and molecular composition documentation
  - Specification sheet identifying safety attributes
  - Full copies of safety-supporting publications (abstracts not accepted)

**Regulatory Citations:**
- FD&C Act Section 413(a)(2)
- FDA Guidance: "Dietary Supplements: New Dietary Ingredient Notification Procedures and Timeframes" (March 2024)

**Confidentiality:** For 90 days after filing, FDA will not disclose notification content. After 90 days, notifications become publicly available on www.regulations.gov.

### 1.4 Specific Examples of Ingredients Permitted in Supplements but NOT in Conventional Food

The following ingredients are permissible in dietary supplements but are **not approved food additives** or established as GRAS for use in conventional food:

#### **Melatonin**
- **Status:** Lawful in dietary supplements with appropriate labeling restrictions
- **Conventional Food:** FDA is not aware of data establishing safety for use in conventional foods
- **FDA Position:** FDA has issued warning letters to companies marketing melatonin-containing products as conventional beverages

#### **Botanical Ingredients:**
The following botanicals are commonly found in dietary supplements but have not been approved for use in conventional foods:
- **Ginkgo biloba** - Memory and cognitive function support
- **Echinacea** - Immune system support
- **Ginseng (Panax and Siberian)** - Energy and vitality
- **St. John's Wort** - Mood support
- **Saw Palmetto** - Prostate health
- **Garlic extract** - Cardiovascular support
- **Milk Thistle** - Liver support

**FDA Enforcement:** FDA has sent warning letters to food companies adding ginkgo biloba, Siberian ginseng, and echinacea to conventional foods, stating these herbs have never been approved for consumption in food.

#### **Specialty Supplement Ingredients:**
- **Glucosamine** - Joint health (derived from shellfish shells or lab-synthesized)
- **Chondroitin** - Joint health (from shark/bovine cartilage or lab-synthesized)
- **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)** - Cellular energy and antioxidant
- **MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane)** - Joint support
- **Probiotics (specific strains)** - Digestive health
- **Alpha-lipoic acid** - Antioxidant
- **L-carnitine** - Energy metabolism

**Key Point:** These ingredients do not naturally occur in significant amounts in conventional foods or lack GRAS status for intentional addition to foods.

### 1.5 Dietary Ingredient Definition

Under FD&C Act Section 201(ff), "dietary ingredient" includes:
- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Herbs or other botanicals
- Amino acids
- Dietary substances for use by humans to supplement the diet
- Concentrates, metabolites, constituents, extracts, or combinations of the above

---

## 2. LABELING CLAIMS

### 2.1 Structure/Function Claims (Permitted on Dietary Supplements)

**Regulatory Citation:** 21 CFR 101.93

**Definition:** Statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in maintaining normal healthy structures or functions of the body.

**Permitted Claims Examples:**
- "Supports immune health"
- "Promotes cardiovascular function"
- "Helps maintain healthy joints"
- "Supports brain function"
- "Maintains healthy cholesterol levels already within normal range"

**Requirements:**
1. **No Premarket Approval:** FDA does not pre-approve structure/function claims
2. **Manufacturer Substantiation:** Manufacturers must have substantiation that claims are truthful and not misleading
3. **30-Day Notification:** Must notify FDA Office of Dietary Supplement Programs no later than 30 days after first marketing
4. **Mandatory Disclaimer:** Label must include the following disclaimer:

   > "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."

5. **Certification:** Manufacturer must certify that information is complete and accurate, with substantiation

**Prohibited:** Structure/function claims **cannot** imply diagnosis, treatment, cure, or prevention of disease. Such claims would make the product a drug.

**Regulatory Citation:** 21 CFR 101.93(f) and (g)

### 2.2 Health Claims (Both Food and Supplements)

**Regulatory Citation:** 21 CFR 101.14

**Definition:** Statements describing a relationship between a food substance (food, food component, or dietary supplement ingredient) and reduced risk of a disease or health-related condition.

**Key Differences from Structure/Function Claims:**
- Health claims **require premarket review and authorization** by FDA
- Must demonstrate "significant scientific agreement" (SSA) among qualified experts
- Based on totality of publicly available scientific evidence

**Authorization Process:**
1. Manufacturer must petition FDA with scientific evidence
2. FDA evaluates evidence using SSA standard
3. FDA promulgates a regulation authorizing the claim (if approved)

**Approved Health Claim Examples:**
- Calcium and osteoporosis
- Dietary fat and cancer
- Sodium and hypertension
- Dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease
- Fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer
- Folate and neural tube defects
- Soluble fiber from certain foods and risk of coronary heart disease
- Soy protein and risk of coronary heart disease

**Qualified Health Claims:**
- Based on emerging but not yet conclusive scientific evidence
- Must include qualifying language to prevent misleading consumers
- Less stringent than SSA standard but still require FDA review

**Critical Distinction:** A claim that a product may **cure, mitigate, or treat a disease** is a **drug claim**, while a claim that a food may **reduce risk of a disease** is a **health claim**.

### 2.3 Nutrient Content Claims

**Regulatory Citation:** 21 CFR 101.13 and Subpart D

**Definition:** Claims that characterize the level of a nutrient in a food (e.g., "high," "low," "free," "reduced").

**Application:** Apply to both conventional foods and dietary supplements

**Key Differences for Dietary Supplements:**

1. **Dietary Ingredients Without RDI/DRV:**
   - May characterize percentage levels of dietary ingredients without Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV)
   - No specific regulation required (under FD&C Act Section 403(r)(2)(F))
   - Example: "Twice the omega-3 fatty acids per capsule (80 mg) as in 100 mg of menhaden oil (40 mg)"

2. **Calorie/Fat Claims Restrictions:**
   - Claims for calories, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may not be made on products meeting "calorie free" or "low calorie" criteria
   - Exception: When comparing to similar dietary supplement that normally exceeds "low calorie" definition

3. **Comparative Claims:**
   - Must clearly identify reference food
   - Must declare actual amounts of dietary ingredient in both products

### 2.4 Disease Claims (Prohibited on Supplements as Foods)

Claims that a dietary supplement can diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease cause the product to be regulated as a **drug**, not a dietary supplement.

**Examples of Prohibited Claims:**
- "Cures arthritis"
- "Treats diabetes"
- "Prevents Alzheimer's disease"
- "Effective treatment for cancer"

**Regulatory Consequence:** Products making disease claims are subject to drug approval requirements, including premarket approval under FD&C Act Section 505.

## 3. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

### 3.1 DSHEA (Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994)

**Statutory Basis:** Public Law 103-417, enacted October 25, 1994

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Definition of Dietary Supplements:**
   - Codified dietary supplements as a distinct subset of food
   - Established that "dietary ingredients" are not "food additives"
   - Created separate safety standard for supplement ingredients

2. **Intended Use Distinction:**
   - Supplements must be intended for ingestion in specific forms: tablet, capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap, or liquid
   - Must be labeled as "dietary supplement"
   - **Cannot** be represented for use as conventional food or sole item of a meal

**Regulatory Citation:** FD&C Act Section 201(ff)(2)(B)

3. **Legal Status:**
   - Dietary supplements are deemed to be "food" within meaning of FD&C Act (except for purposes of Sections 201(g) and 417)
   - Subject to food safety requirements but with distinct regulatory pathway

### 3.2 Premarket Approval Differences

#### **Conventional Foods and Food Additives:**

**Food Additives (since 1958 Food Additives Amendment):**
- Must undergo **premarket approval process**
- Manufacturer bears burden of demonstrating safety
- FDA must approve before marketing
- Extensive safety data required

**GRAS Substances:**
- May be self-determined by manufacturers
- Voluntary notification to FDA (since 1997)
- Based on common use in food or scientific consensus

#### **Dietary Supplements under DSHEA:**

**No Premarket Approval:**
- FDA is **not authorized** to approve dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness before marketing
- No premarket approval process required
- Products can go to market without FDA review

**New Dietary Ingredients (NDI):**
- Must submit premarket safety notification 75 days before marketing
- Must provide basis for safety conclusion
- FDA does not "approve" - reviews for adequacy of safety information

**Key Difference:** Supplements can contain ingredients not GRAS, approved food additives, or otherwise sanctioned for use in conventional food.

### 3.3 Safety Burden Differences (Critical Distinction)

#### **Conventional Foods:**
- **Since 1938:** FDA bears burden of establishing food as unsafe
- **Food Additives:** Manufacturer must prove safety before approval (premarket)

#### **Dietary Supplements (DSHEA Framework):**

**FDA Bears Burden of Proof:**
- Supplements assumed safe unless FDA has evidence proving otherwise
- FDA must demonstrate that supplement presents **"significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury"**
- FDA **cannot** require manufacturer to provide safety data (unlike food additives or drugs)

**Manufacturer Responsibilities:**
- Must ensure products are safe before marketing
- Must have substantiation for claims
- Must comply with good manufacturing practices (GMPs)

**Enforcement Standard:** FD&C Act Section 402(f) - FDA must show:
- Significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, OR
- New dietary ingredient without adequate safety notification

**Critical Implication:** This reversed burden of proof makes FDA enforcement against unsafe supplements more challenging compared to food additives, where manufacturers must prove safety upfront.

### 3.4 Post-Market Surveillance and Enforcement

**Both Conventional Foods and Dietary Supplements:**
- Subject to FDA inspection and enforcement
- Must comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations
- Subject to adverse event reporting requirements

**Dietary Supplement-Specific:**
- Serious adverse event reporting required under Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (2006)
- FDA can take action against adulterated or misbranded products
- Must meet CGMP requirements under 21 CFR Part 111

## 7. CONCLUSION

The regulatory distinction between conventional food products and dietary supplements represents a fundamental difference in FDA oversight philosophy:

**Conventional Foods:** Preventive regulation with premarket approval for added ingredients, FDA bears enforcement burden for unsafe foods but manufacturers must prove safety of food additives.

**Dietary Supplements:** Post-market surveillance model where products can reach market without premarket approval, FDA bears burden of proving safety problems exist.

This distinction creates both opportunities and responsibilities:

**Opportunities:**
- Dietary supplement manufacturers can market ingredients not permitted in conventional foods
- Broader claim-making ability via structure/function claims
- Faster time-to-market without premarket approval

**Responsibilities:**
- Ensuring safety without FDA premarket review
- Maintaining substantiation for all claims
- Strict compliance with labeling requirements
- Avoiding disease claims that trigger drug classification

**For Compliance:** Understanding these distinctions is critical for:
- Proper product classification
- Ingredient selection and sourcing
- Label claim development
- Regulatory risk management

Manufacturers must carefully evaluate whether their product should be marketed as a conventional food or dietary supplement, as this classification determines all subsequent regulatory obligations.
