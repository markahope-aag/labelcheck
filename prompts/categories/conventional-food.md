## STEP 2: COMPLIANCE EVALUATION

### 1. STATEMENT OF IDENTITY

Check:
- Product name clear and prominent?
- Uses common/usual name?
- **ðŸš¨ MISLEADING TERMS**: "Superfood" (not FDA-defined), "Detox"/"Cleanse" (disease treatment), "Miracle" (exaggerated), "Cure"/"Treat" (drug claims)

Status: Compliant | Potentially-Non-Compliant | Non-Compliant

### 2. NET QUANTITY

Check: Proper units, bottom 30%, both US/metric

Status: Compliant | Potentially-Non-Compliant | Non-Compliant

### 3. NUTRITION FACTS PANEL

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL - Panel Type:**
- Has "Supplement Facts" instead? â†’ NON-COMPLIANT ("Conventional foods must use Nutrition Facts panel per 21 CFR 101.9")
- Missing panel when required? â†’ NON-COMPLIANT

**IF NUTRITION FACTS PRESENT, validate:**

#### A. Format: Title, serving size, all required nutrients, proper bold/indent

#### B. Rounding Validation (21 CFR 101.9(c)) - ðŸš¨ CRITICAL

**Calories:**
- <5 cal â†’ 0
- 5-50 cal â†’ nearest 5
- >50 cal â†’ nearest 10

**Fat/Sat Fat/Trans Fat/Cholesterol/Sodium:**
- <0.5g (or <2mg chol, <5mg sodium) â†’ 0
- <5g (or <50mg) â†’ nearest 0.5g (or 5mg)
- â‰¥5g (or â‰¥50mg) â†’ nearest 1g (or 10mg)

**Carb/Fiber/Sugars/Protein:**
- <1g â†’ "less than 1g" or 0 if <0.5g
- â‰¥1g â†’ nearest 1g

**Vitamins/Minerals (as % DV):**
- <2% â†’ may use 0 or "<2%"
- â‰¥2% â†’ nearest 2% increment

Check for rounding errors, mathematical impossibilities

Set in JSON:
- `panel_type_present`, `panel_type_required`, `panel_type_correct`
- `rounding_validation.status`: "compliant" | "non_compliant" | "not_applicable"
- `rounding_validation.errors`: Array of specific errors

Status: Compliant | Potentially-Non-Compliant | Non-Compliant

### 4. INGREDIENT LIST

Check: Descending order, sub-ingredients in parentheses, flavors/colors/preservatives proper

Status: Compliant | Potentially-Non-Compliant | Non-Compliant

### 5. ALLERGEN LABELING (FALCPA/FASTER)

**STEP 1**: Are ANY of 9 major allergens present in ingredients?

**STEP 2**: IF NO â†’ Status: "compliant" ("No major food allergens detected")

**STEP 3**: IF YES â†’ Check "Contains:" or parenthetical declarations

**ðŸš¨ RULE**: ONLY "potentially_non_compliant"/"non_compliant" if allergens CONFIRMED PRESENT. Zero allergens = "compliant".

Status: Compliant | Potentially-Non-Compliant | Non-Compliant

### 6. NUTRIENT CONTENT CLAIMS (if present)

Validate against 21 CFR 101.13:
- "Low fat": â‰¤3g/serving
- "Low sodium": â‰¤140mg/serving
- "High"/"Excellent source": â‰¥20% DV/serving
- "Good source": 10-19% DV/serving
- "Free": <0.5g/serving (or <5 cal)
- "Light": 1/3 fewer cal OR 50% less fat
- "Reduced": 25% less than reference

Check nutrition panel supports claim

Populate JSON for each claim:
```json
{
  "claim_text": "...",
  "claim_type": "nutrient_content",
  "classification": "compliant|prohibited|needs_review",
  "rationale": "..."
}
```

### 7. HEALTH CLAIMS (if present)

Check if using authorized FDA claim with exact wording:
- Calcium/vitamin D and osteoporosis
- Sodium and hypertension
- Dietary fat and cancer
- Fiber and coronary heart disease
- Soy protein and heart disease
- Plant sterol/stanol esters and heart disease
- etc.

Flag unauthorized claims as NON-COMPLIANT

### 8. FORTIFICATION POLICY

If fortified (vitamins/minerals added):
- Appropriate vehicle? (staple grains OK, candy/soda generally not)
- Restoring nutrients lost in processing?
- Creates nutrient imbalance?

## STEP 3: OVERALL ASSESSMENT

Determine primary_compliance_status:
- **Compliant**: Meets all requirements
- **Potentially-Non-Compliant**: Likely violations, depends on missing info
- **Non-Compliant**: Clear violations (wrong panel, false claims, rounding errors)

Provide 2-3 sentence summary: Nutrition Facts panel correct? Major issues? Critical areas?

---

## STEP 4: RECOMMENDATIONS

Prioritize:
- **CRITICAL**: Wrong panel, false claims, missing allergens, rounding violations
- **HIGH**: Incomplete info, unclear claims
- **MEDIUM**: Minor formatting
- **LOW**: Best practices

Each: Specific action, regulation citation, priority

---

## REMEMBER: Category Confidence

Since this is CONVENTIONAL_FOOD, set:
- `"category_confidence": "high"`
- `"category_ambiguity": { "is_ambiguous": false, ... }`

Only `is_ambiguous: true` if STRONG evidence wrong (e.g., Supplement Facts panel, TTB alcohol warning)
